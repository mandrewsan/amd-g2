title: "3 Ways You'll Lose Your Money in Costa Rica",
date: "2014-09-25 02:38:22"
---

Planning on visiting one of the most internationally popular, well-spoken-of country in Central America? You won't have your dream vacation without paying for it. Here are a few ways the country will take money out of your pocket when you aren't expecting it.\r\n\r\n<strong>1. Your rental car will cost you way more than you think.\r\n<\/strong>\r\n\r\nSo be sure to plan this part at the higher end of your budget. If you've already looked at the cost of reserving a rental car in Costa Rica online, you've probably seen some good-looking rates. I've seen them go as low as $2 per day with some companies. The crappy thing is, your final quote probably doesn't include a proper insurance quote, which can make a considerable difference, depending on the car you get and the number of days you plan to rent.\r\n\r\nFirst, your own car insurance won't work. The Costa Rican government has strict laws on car insurance, so it will be mandatory for you to purchase at least the lowest insurance offered through your rental car company. You probably won't find out the final amount until you get there, but you should probably factor in between <a href=\"http:\/\/costa-rica-guide.com\/CarRentalInsurance.html\">$5 - $20 per day<\/a>. My quote before getting to Costa Rica was under $100 for 14 days. I was stoked. When I got my quote there, I was charged over $800. Big difference.\r\n\r\nSecond, depending on where you're going, renting the cheapest 2-wheel drive car may not be the best decision. There are certain roads you can get stuck on without 4-wheel drive, so make sure you do your research. Specifically, I had Drake Bay on my list, which added a considerable amount of driving to the itinerary once I realized the quickest route there was covered with holes and deep water during certain parts of the year. Needless to say, a 4-wheel drive will be the best move, but will cost you a lot more to rent.\r\n\r\nThird, several roads in certain parts are not well-kept, and drivers are not always at their safest. Plan on having some kind of scuff or ding on your car by the time you have to return it. Even if you stay in the city, no one will stop someone from leaning on your car or even breaking in when you aren't there to protect it. You'll want insurance, and it's probably why it costs so much in the first place.\r\n\r\n<strong>2. Certain traffic citations can cost you over $600 apiece.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nApparently, Costa Rica has the <a href=\"http:\/\/costa-rica-car-rental.autorent.cr\/trafficfines\/\">highest traffic fines in the Americas<\/a>, something the travel guide probably didn't disclose to you. Violations like speeding and running red lights are in the same bracket (the highest), and will cost you much more than they would ate home. I personally got a ticket for illegal passing by crossing the double yellow lines way out in the countryside, and got fined as if I had been drunk, armed and ran over an expensive goat.\r\n\r\nTo be fair, it's probably not the best country to drive poorly in, especially with all of the crappy roads and crazy drivers. All of that intensifies when you drive at night. You'll want to be always on the defense whenever you're on the road. That being said, several roads have extremely slow speed limits (30 km\/h in some spots in the city), and there are speed cameras to catch you when you think no one's looking (especially in San Jose). Don't speed. Don't break any traffic law. Even if everyone around you is driving horrendously, the cop will pull you over just because it happens to be your lucky day.\r\n\r\nIf you do end up getting a ticket. you'll have a chance to pay it when you turn in your rental car. They have a reporting system tied to your vehicle's ID, so your rental car company will see it and tack it onto your final bill. You can also pay it before hand at a national bank, in which case it will show up as paid when you turn in your rental. If you try to leave without paying, locals say you'll be stopped at the airport, the fine will be double and you'll have to pay it in cash before leaving the country.\r\n\r\n<strong>3. You have to pay to leave the country, anyway.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nIf you think you haven't paid enough for your overpriced Costa Rican vacation, you haven't seen the end of it 'til you're ready to bail. As of now (September 23, 2014), there is a $29 fee per person to leave Costa Rica, paid at the airport (ref. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.liberiacostaricaairport.net\/Entry_Exit_Requirements.html\">Liberia Airport<\/a>). If you're planning your honeymoon, like I was, that means you'll need to factor $54 more into your budget, just to get back home.\r\n\r\nIf you think it's annoying and greedy, <a href=\"http:\/\/travelogue.travelvice.com\/peru\/airport-departure-tax-is-a-greedy-annoyance\/\">you aren't the only one<\/a>. But quite frankly, there's nothing you can do. You'll just have to suck it up and pay.\r\n\r\nWikipedia has a <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Departure_tax\">list of countries that also charge a lame departure tax<\/a>. While Fiji takes the cake at around $110, Costa Rica surely isn't the cheapest among the greedy lot.\r\n\r\n<strong>So bring money, and lots of it!<\/strong>\r\n\r\nFolks, to be fair, it's one of the most beautiful places to visit in the Americas, and arguably one of the safest in Latin America. But best believe, you will pay every last dollar for your dream vacation in this enchanting little country, so be sure to save up and count on splurging once you get there.

Costa Rica has something for everyone, and has more to see than you'll likely have time for. I had the opportunity to visit a lot more than I would recommend anyone else visit in 2 short weeks, and I'll share with you a few of my favorites so you can plan your next trip a little better. This is in no way meant to be a complete guide, but you can use it to start your research and have an awesome time! <!--more Read post-->\r\n\r\n<strong>1. Heredia<\/strong>\r\n\r\nHeredia is a small university town just north of the capital (San Jose). You'll find tons of urban shopping, good eats, and decent hotels - very different from the nature most people expect when they visit the country.\r\n\r\nI tried using <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lonelyplanet.com\/costa-rica\/central-valley-and-highlands\/heredia-area\/things-to-do\">Lonely Planet<\/a> for suggestions, but they're a hit or miss. Eat at Espigas for breakfast (you will never go wrong ordering Casado, which is their typical beans and rice dish with a protein and some fruit). Try their natural smoothies. One awesome thing about Latin America as a whole is the abundance of fresh, natural fruit and real fruit smoothies wherever you go - take advantage of the natural goodness. Skip the Cowboy Steakhouse if you actually like steak - it isn't really anything to brag about. You're better off trying something new and more typical Costa Rican. Go to the Parque Central, find a place to park (pay the parking guy if he's there) and explore the town. There is a swap-meet type of area on certain days, so you can buy souvenirs to take home. If you're lucky, a band will be there performing, so you can hang out, drink your smoothie and enjoy the people and atmosphere.\r\n\r\nAfter you've explored the city, set your GPS to visit the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.waterfallgardens.com\/\">La Paz Waterfall Gardens<\/a>. It's about an hour drive north of Heredia, and it's one of my favorite attractions in the entire country. It will cost you $38 per adult, and is worth every dollar. There you'll see more animals than you probably imagined ever seeing in Costa Rica. You can go into the aviary and hold &amp; feed toucans. You can go into the mariposario and surround yourself with exotic butterflies. If that's not enough, you can visit the big cats area and watch them feed pumas, ocelots, and jaguars in the afternoon - from just a few feet away! When you've had enough of the animals, you can continue on to the waterfall section, where you'll see breathtaking views of their several giant waterfalls. Watch out as you exit the park - coatimundis (pizotes) hang out near the garbage and like to raid it when the tourists aren't looking.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Td2pf7ctmas?list=UUT0yn2f6dQI4QuCPxdf2N8g\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>\r\n<iframe src=\"\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/SEl0fQOOGXY?list=UUT0yn2f6dQI4QuCPxdf2N8g\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\n<strong>2. Puerto Viejo<\/strong>\r\n\r\nA small Caribbean town on the east coast of the country, close to the border with Panama, Puerto Viejo is a good time and a half for tourists. You'll see tons of people from all over the world - some who have retired and live there, and others who are just passing through. You'll hear reggae music every few hundred meters, and will get to see a different side of Costa Rica that definitely has its own flavor.\r\n\r\nWhen you get to wherever you're staying, definitely get out and explore the town on foot. There are tons of places to buy souvenirs and crafts, and great restaurants to try out right on the main road. The vibe is really friendly, so you should even be safe walking around at night and catching some of the fun evening activities, like restaurants and bars with bands playing, and karaoke nights.\r\n\r\nDuring the day I'd recommend visiting the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jaguarrescue.com\/\">Jaguar Rescue Center<\/a>, which you'll need to drive or hitch a ride to. It's another one of the best places to see animals up close in Costa Rica, and shouldn't cost you more than $20. They have a great collection of venomous snakes, both types of sloths, anteaters and a few cats. They also have some local deer that, if they like you, will lick you to death. The best part is visiting the monkey area, where you'll have the opportunity to go inside the monkey habitat and play with some of the monkeys!<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Screen-Shot-2014-09-24-at-9.59.17-PM.png\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-48 size-medium\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Screen-Shot-2014-09-24-at-9.59.17-PM-300x300.png\" alt=\"Two Toed Sloth in Puerto Viejo, Costa Rica\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nFurther down the road is a <a href=\"http:\/\/caribeanscr.com\/chocolate-tour.html\">chocolate tour<\/a>, which you'll have to catch at a certain hour to do. You'll get a tour of the chocolate farm, and see the process of how chocolate is made. I wasn't lucky enough to make the tour, but at the store down front I bought some artisan chocolate and the guy was even nice enough to let me and my wife take a cacau fruit! If you haven't experienced that, you definitely need to take the tour. If they don't let you taste the cacau, beg them, bribe them, do whatever it takes to get one!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>3. Monteverde<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThis is a small town up in the mountains. The best thing to do here is to visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.selvatura.com\/\">Selvatura Park<\/a>, which deep in the dense rainforest. It rains a lot, and you may experience muddy roads on your way up, so drive safely and don't be in a rush. The temperature is also relatively low, with cool winds, so I'd recommend using a windbreaker (get a dark-colored one; I'll explain shortly).\r\n\r\nAt the park is one of the highest zipline attractions in the country. There are thirteen lines total, and the biggest one is 1 km long. The views are amazing, the experience is one-of-a-kind, and the people are super friendly. Don't make the mistake I made by wearing light-colored clothing, because the combination of rain and mud you'll go through as you hike up the course and get on the ziplines will have you filthy (my white hoodie is still soiled after tons of washes). You want your jacket to deflect the water and dirt, not absorb it!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Screen-Shot-2014-09-24-at-10.00.08-PM.png\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-50 size-medium\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Screen-Shot-2014-09-24-at-10.00.08-PM-300x300.png\" alt=\"Hanging Bridge in Selvatura Park, Costa Rica\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a>After the zipline tour, you can do the hanging bridge walk and take an opportunity to walk through the forest at your own pace. If you're lucky, you'll encounter exotic birds and maybe a pizote here and there.\r\n\r\nAlso in the area are night tours, which you can do through Selvatura as well. You might be exhausted by then, but if you want to see animals like sloths, snakes, frogs, porcupines and rodents in their natural habitat, the night tour might be worth it. Otherwise, rest up and get ready for the next day's adventure.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>4. Arenal<\/strong>\r\n\r\nIf you're a driver, the road from Monteverde to Arenal I'd say is one of the funnest roads to drive in the country. There are certain stretches near the lake that are generally safe and well-kept, so you won't have to worry about hitting potholes. Be careful passing other drivers on the road, as it will be hard to see beyond the curves ahead of you.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Screen-Shot-2014-09-24-at-9.59.52-PM.png\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-49 size-medium\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Screen-Shot-2014-09-24-at-9.59.52-PM-298x300.png\" alt=\"View from Hotel La Fortuna, Arenal, Costa Rica\" width=\"298\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a>When you get to Arenal, get settled in your hotel and get out of there. This is a small town at considerable elevation, situated near a large volcano called Arenal. If you're lucky, it won't be covered in clouds while you're there, and you'll get a chance to see it (I wasn't able to). If not, don't worry - there are tons of other things to do. Have some tasty local food, because in general it should be inexpensive and very good here. As with much of the country, you should be prepared for rain at all times - you don't want to get caught outside with nothing to cover up. Take some time to visit local shops and buy some nice souvenirs (I could have brought home a suitcase full of stuff from Arenal).\r\n\r\nBefore it gets dark, make sure you take some time to take the main road down to Tabac\u00f3n Hot Springs (assuming you don't have a resort with its own hot springs). Take it down about 15 minutes past all the resorts, and keep your eyes on the right side of the road. You'll see a yellow gate. Park on the side of the road and follow that small side-road past that gate. In a couple of minutes you'll find a flowing river of hot water! Depending on the time of day, there may be other people there. If it's crowded, just keep moving up the river until you find your spot. You definitely won't regret it.\r\n<iframe src=\"\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/hmySvdyZlws?list=UUT0yn2f6dQI4QuCPxdf2N8g\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>

Costa Rica has something for everyone, and has more to see than you'll likely have time for. I had the opportunity to visit a lot more than I would recommend anyone else visit in 2 short weeks, and I'll share with you a few of my favorites so you can plan your next trip a little better. This is in no way meant to be a complete guide, but you can use it to start your research and have an awesome time!\r\n\r\n<strong>1. Heredia<\/strong>\r\n\r\nHeredia is a small university town just north of the capital (San Jose). You'll find tons of urban shopping, good eats, and decent hotels - very different from the nature most people expect when they visit the country.\r\n\r\nI tried using <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lonelyplanet.com\/costa-rica\/central-valley-and-highlands\/heredia-area\/things-to-do\">Lonely Planet<\/a> for suggestions, but they're a hit or miss. Eat at Espigas for breakfast (you will never go wrong ordering Casado, which is their typical beans and rice dish with a protein and some fruit). Try their natural smoothies. One awesome thing about Latin America as a whole is the abundance of fresh, natural fruit and real fruit smoothies wherever you go - take advantage of the natural goodness. Skip the Cowboy Steakhouse if you actually like steak - it isn't really anything to brag about. You're better off trying something new and more typical Costa Rican. Go to the Parque Central, find a place to park (pay the parking guy if he's there) and explore the town. There is a swap-meet type of area on certain days, so you can buy souvenirs to take home. If you're lucky, a band will be there performing, so you can hang out, drink your smoothie and enjoy the people and atmosphere.\r\n\r\nAfter you've explored the city, set your GPS to visit the La Paz Waterfall Gardens. It's about an hour drive north of Heredia, and it's one of my favorite attractions in the entire country. It will cost you $38 per adult, and is worth every dollar. There you'll see more animals than you probably imagined ever seeing in Costa Rica. You can go into the aviary and hold &amp; feed toucans. You can go into the mariposario and surround yourself with exotic butterflies. If that's not enough, you can visit the big cats area and watch them feed pumas, ocelots, and jaguars in the afternoon - from just a few feet away! When you've had enough of the animals, you can continue on to the waterfall section, where you'll see breathtaking views of their several giant waterfalls. Watch out as you exit the park - coatimundis (pizotes) hang out near the garbage and like to raid it when the tourists aren't looking.\r\n\r\n<strong>2. Puerto Viejo<\/strong>\r\n\r\nA small Caribbean town on the east coast of the country, close to the border with Panama, Puerto Viejo is a good time and a half for tourists. You'll see tons of people from all over the world - some who have retired and live there, and others who are just passing through. You'll hear reggae music every few hundred meters, and will get to see a different side of Costa Rica that definitely has its own flavor.\r\n\r\nWhen you get to wherever you're staying, definitely get out and explore the town on foot. There are tons of places to buy souvenirs and crafts, and great restaurants to try out right on the main road. The vibe is really friendly, so you should even be safe walking around at night and catching some of the fun evening activities, like restaurants and bars with bands playing, and karaoke nights.\r\n\r\nDuring the day I'd recommend visiting the Jaguar Rescue Center, which you'll need to drive or hitch a ride to. It's another one of the best places to see animals up close in Costa Rica, and shouldn't cost you more than $20. They have a great collection of venomous snakes, both types of sloths, anteaters and a few cats. They also have some local deer that, if they like you, will lick you to death. The best part is visiting the monkey area, where you'll have the opportunity to go inside the monkey habitat and play with some of the monkeys!\r\n\r\nFurther down the road is a chocolate tour, which you'll have to catch at a certain hour to do. You'll get a tour of the chocolate farm, and see the process of how chocolate is made. I wasn't lucky enough to make the tour, but at the store down front I bought some artisan chocolate and the guy was even nice enough to let me and my wife take a cacau fruit! If you haven't experienced that, you definitely need to take the tour. If they don't let you taste the cacau, beg them, bribe them, do whatever it takes to get one!\r\n\r\n<strong>3. Monteverde<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThis is a small town up in the mountains. The best thing to do here is to visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.selvatura.com\/\">Selvatura Park<\/a>, which deep in the dense rainforest. It rains a lot, and you may experience muddy roads on your way up, so drive safely and don't be in a rush. The temperature is also relatively low, with cool winds, so I'd recommend using a windbreaker (get a dark-colored one; I'll explain shortly).\r\n\r\nAt the park is one of the highest zipline attractions in the country. There are thirteen lines total, and the biggest one is 1 km long. The views are amazing, the experience is one-of-a-kind, and the people are super friendly. Don't make the mistake I made by wearing light-colored clothing, because the combination of rain and mud you'll go through as you hike up the course and get on the ziplines will have you filthy (my white hoodie is still soiled after tons of washes). You want your jacket to deflect the water and dirt, not absorb it!\r\n\r\nAfter the zipline tour, you can do the hanging bridge walk and take an opportunity to walk through the forest at your own pace. If you're lucky, you'll encounter exotic birds and maybe a pizote here and there.\r\n\r\nAlso in the area are night tours, which you can do through Selvatura as well. You might be exhausted by then, but if you want to see animals like sloths, snakes, frogs, porcupines and rodents in their natural habitat, the night tour might be worth it. Otherwise, rest up and get ready for the next day's adventure.\r\n\r\n<strong>4. Arenal<\/strong>\r\n\r\nIf you're a driver, the road from Monteverde to Arenal I'd say is one of the funnest roads to drive in the country. There are certain stretches near the lake that are generally safe and well-kept, so you won't have to worry about hitting potholes. Be careful passing other drivers on the road, as it will be hard to see beyond the curves ahead of you.\r\n\r\nWhen you get to Arenal, get settled in your hotel and get out of there. This is a small town at considerable elevation, situated near a large volcano called Arenal. If you're lucky, it won't be covered in clouds while you're there, and you'll get a chance to see it (I wasn't able to). If not, don't worry - there are tons of other things to do. Have some tasty local food, because in general it should be inexpensive and very good here. As with much of the country, you should be prepared for rain at all times - you don't want to get caught outside with nothing to cover up. Take some time to visit local shops and buy some nice souvenirs (I could have brought home a suitcase full of stuff from Arenal).\r\n\r\nBefore it gets dark, make sure you take some time to take the main road down to Tabac\u00f3n Hot Springs (assuming you don't have a resort with its own hot springs). Take it down about 15 minutes past all the resorts, and keep your eyes on the right side of the road. You'll see a yellow gate. Park on the side of the road and follow that small side-road past that gate. In a couple of minutes you'll find a flowing river of hot water! Depending on the time of day, there may be other people there. If it's crowded, just keep moving up the river until you find your spot. You definitely won't regret it.\r\n<iframe src=\"\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/hmySvdyZlws?list=UUT0yn2f6dQI4QuCPxdf2N8g\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>

Skip the Cowboy Steakhouse if you actually like steak - it isn't really anything to brag about. You're better off trying something new and more typical Costa Rican. Go to the Parque Central, find a place to park (pay the parking guy if he's there) and explore the town. There is a swap-meet type of area on certain days, so you can buy souvenirs to take home. If you're lucky, a band will be there performing, so you can hang out, drink your smoothie and enjoy the people and atmosphere.\r\n\r\nAfter you've explored the city, set your GPS to visit the La Paz Waterfall Gardens. It's about an hour drive north of Heredia, and it's one of my favorite attractions in the entire country. It will cost you $38 per adult, and is worth every dollar. There you'll see more animals than you probably imagined ever seeing in Costa Rica. You can go into the aviary and hold &amp; feed toucans. You can go into the mariposario and surround yourself with exotic butterflies. If that's not enough, you can visit the big cats area and watch them feed pumas, ocelots, and jaguars in the afternoon - from just a few feet away! When you've had enough of the animals, you can continue on to the waterfall section, where you'll see breathtaking views of their several giant waterfalls. Watch out as you exit the park - coatimundis (pizotes) hang out near the garbage and like to raid it when the tourists aren't looking.\r\n<iframe src=\"\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Td2pf7ctmas?list=UUT0yn2f6dQI4QuCPxdf2N8g\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>\r\n<iframe src=\"\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/SEl0fQOOGXY?list=UUT0yn2f6dQI4QuCPxdf2N8g\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\n<strong>2. Puerto Viejo<\/strong>\r\n\r\nA small Caribbean town on the east coast of the country, close to the border with Panama, Puerto Viejo is a good time and a half for tourists. You'll see tons of people from all over the world - some who have retired and live there, and others who are just passing through. You'll hear reggae music every few hundred meters, and will get to see a different side of Costa Rica that definitely has its own flavor.\r\n\r\nWhen you get to wherever you're staying, definitely get out and explore the town on foot. There are tons of places to buy souvenirs and crafts, and great restaurants to try out right on the main road. The vibe is really friendly, so you should even be safe walking around at night and catching some of the fun evening activities, like restaurants and bars with bands playing, and karaoke nights.\r\n\r\nDuring the day I'd recommend visiting the Jaguar Rescue Center, which you'll need to drive or hitch a ride to. It's another one of the best places to see animals up close in Costa Rica, and shouldn't cost you more than $20. They have a great collection of venomous snakes, both types of sloths, anteaters and a few cats. They also have some local deer that, if they like you, will lick you to death. The best part is visiting the monkey area, where you'll have the opportunity to go inside the monkey habitat and play with some of the monkeys!\r\n\r\nFurther down the road is a chocolate tour, which you'll have to catch at a certain hour to do. You'll get a tour of the chocolate farm, and see the process of how chocolate is made. I wasn't lucky enough to make the tour, but at the store down front I bought some artisan chocolate and the guy was even nice enough to let me and my wife take a cacau fruit! If you haven't experienced that, you definitely need to take the tour. If they don't let you taste the cacau, beg them, bribe them, do whatever it takes to get one!\r\n\r\n<strong>3. Monteverde<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThis is a small town up in the mountains. The best thing to do here is to visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.selvatura.com\/\">Selvatura Park<\/a>, which deep in the dense rainforest. It rains a lot, and you may experience muddy roads on your way up, so drive safely and don't be in a rush. The temperature is also relatively low, with cool winds, so I'd recommend using a windbreaker (get a dark-colored one; I'll explain shortly).\r\n\r\nAt the park is one of the highest zipline attractions in the country. There are thirteen lines total, and the biggest one is 1 km long. The views are amazing, the experience is one-of-a-kind, and the people are super friendly. Don't make the mistake I made by wearing light-colored clothing, because the combination of rain and mud you'll go through as you hike up the course and get on the ziplines will have you filthy (my white hoodie is still soiled after tons of washes). You want your jacket to deflect the water and dirt, not absorb it!\r\n\r\nAfter the zipline tour, you can do the hanging bridge walk and take an opportunity to walk through the forest at your own pace. If you're lucky, you'll encounter exotic birds and maybe a pizote here and there.\r\n\r\nAlso in the area are night tours, which you can do through Selvatura as well. You might be exhausted by then, but if you want to see animals like sloths, snakes, frogs, porcupines and rodents in their natural habitat, the night tour might be worth it. Otherwise, rest up and get ready for the next day's adventure.\r\n\r\n<strong>4. Arenal<\/strong>\r\n\r\nIf you're a driver, the road from Monteverde to Arenal I'd say is one of the funnest roads to drive in the country. There are certain stretches near the lake that are generally safe and well-kept, so you won't have to worry about hitting potholes. Be careful passing other drivers on the road, as it will be hard to see beyond the curves ahead of you.\r\n\r\nWhen you get to Arenal, get settled in your hotel and get out of there. This is a small town at considerable elevation, situated near a large volcano called Arenal. If you're lucky, it won't be covered in clouds while you're there, and you'll get a chance to see it (I wasn't able to). If not, don't worry - there are tons of other things to do. Have some tasty local food, because in general it should be inexpensive and very good here. As with much of the country, you should be prepared for rain at all times - you don't want to get caught outside with nothing to cover up. Take some time to visit local shops and buy some nice souvenirs (I could have brought home a suitcase full of stuff from Arenal).\r\n\r\nBefore it gets dark, make sure you take some time to take the main road down to Tabac\u00f3n Hot Springs (assuming you don't have a resort with its own hot springs). Take it down about 15 minutes past all the resorts, and keep your eyes on the right side of the road. You'll see a yellow gate. Park on the side of the road and follow that small side-road past that gate. In a couple of minutes you'll find a flowing river of hot water! Depending on the time of day, there may be other people there. If it's crowded, just keep moving up the river until you find your spot. You definitely won't regret it.\r\n<iframe src=\"\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/hmySvdyZlws?list=UUT0yn2f6dQI4QuCPxdf2N8g\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>

Costa Rica has something for everyone, and has more to see than you'll likely have time for. I had the opportunity to visit a lot more than I would recommend anyone else visit in 2 short weeks, and I'll share with you a few of my favorites so you can plan your next trip a little better. This is in no way meant to be a complete guide, but you can use it to start your research and have an awesome time!\r\n\r\n<strong>1. Heredia<\/strong>\r\n\r\nHeredia is a small university town just north of the capital (San Jose). You'll find tons of urban shopping, good eats, and decent hotels - very different from the nature most people expect when they visit the country.\r\n\r\nI tried using <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lonelyplanet.com\/costa-rica\/central-valley-and-highlands\/heredia-area\/things-to-do\">Lonely Planet<\/a> for suggestions, but they're a hit or miss.

I overtorqued it, and when it came time to take the lug off, it was too tight and snapped right off. Tons of lessons here, but number one is this: use a torque wrench and torque your lugs, nuts and bolts down to the factory specs. You will be glad you did!\r\n\r\nIn case you haven't already Googled it, lug nuts on a 5th gen Prelude should be torqued to 80 ft-lbs. Bought a torque wrench from Harbor Freight, which cost me about $20. I hear they go on sale a lot.\r\n<h3 id=\"stepone\">1. Prepare new stud<\/h3>\r\nBuy a few studs just in case you have to do this more than once. Of course, buy extra lugs as well. Also, you'll want to buy an angle grinder or something to cut metal. I picked up an angle grinder from Harbor Freight for about $18, and a pack of thin\u00a0wheels for it, about $7. \u00a0I bought the electric kind because I don't have an air compressor.\r\n\r\nWhat you need to do is cut the head of the stud almost in half, so that it fits when you're ready to\u00a0install it. Start from the inside and cut it so that it lays flat. I don't have a picture of mine, but looking at the head from the top down, it should look something like this:\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/cutstud.jpg\"><img class=\" size-full wp-image-244 alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/cutstud.jpg\" alt=\"Stud head top view after being cut\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<em><strong>Please wear gloves and safety glasses!\u00a0<\/strong><\/em>Not only can you lose a finger, but the stud will be hot when you are cutting it.

Remove the brake caliper and the bold holding the brake line<\/h3>\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/20150425_160957.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-228\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/20150425_160957.jpg\" alt=\"Honda Prelude Front Brake Caliper Coming Off\" width=\"3264\" height=\"2448\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nActually, do that in reverse order. Unscrew the bolt so that you have more slack in handling the caliper once it comes off. Then, remove the two bolds securing the caliper.\u00a0I used my floor jack to hold the caliper up, but you should probably use a block of wood.\r\n<h3 id=\"stepfour\">4. Remove rotor<\/h3>\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/20150425_160959.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-231 size-medium alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/20150425_160959-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Honda Prelude Front Caliper Off\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/20150425_163242-e1430586812793.jpg\"><img class=\" size-medium wp-image-233 alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/20150425_163242-e1430586812793-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Honda Prelude Front Brake Rotor Removed\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nGrab a philips screwdriver and remove the screws in front holding the brake rotor in place. This may be pretty stiff and hard to remove. I couldn't get mine off without jarring it loose with a rubber mallet. This is important for hitting that broken stud all the way through the back.\r\n<h3 id=\"stepfive\">5. Handle splash shield<\/h3>\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/20150425_163402.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-234 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/20150425_163402-e1430587046866.jpg\" alt=\"Honda Prelude Broken Stud Coming Out\" width=\"816\" height=\"612\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nI say \"handle\" because you pretty much have to do what you need to do to get it out of your way. Best case scenario, you unscrew it (you'll need a short philips) and remove it. In my case, i could not remove it and ending up bending it back. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Z0avY0p0PU4\">Eric the Car Guy actually cut the one he was working on, and bended it back, in this video<\/a>. I bent mine back in place after the job, and of course, it doesn't look the same. So, \"handle\" your splash shield.\r\n<h3 id=\"stepsix\">6. Hammer out broken stud<\/h3>\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/20150425_163536.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-238 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/20150425_163536-e1430587108641.jpg\" alt=\"Honda Prelude Broken Stud Coming Out - Stuck\" width=\"816\" height=\"612\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nGrab your hammer and hit the broken stud out. At this point, you have a few options. The stud will not come out smoothly because there isn't enough room for you to take it out without taking apart this assembly. Some have hammered it out until it stopped, and then used their grinder to cut the bolt in half to remove it. If you have the right tool and the right amount of room, I recommend this. In my case, I hammered it all the way out, and it rubbed quite a bit before finally falling out. See the image above.\r\n<h3 id=\"stepseven\">7. Hammer in the new stud<\/h3>\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/20150425_164235.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-241 size-medium\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/20150425_164235-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"New Stud Going Into Honda Prelude Front Wheel\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/20150425_164406.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-242\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/20150425_164406-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"New Stud Inside Honda Prelude Front Wheel - Top View\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nNow that the broken stud is out, you can put your new stud in place and hammer it in through the back. The last few millimeters are tough to get through, so you can either use brute force, or \u00a0screw a lug nut on and tighten. The latter is suggested by the same video I referenced above. I did not do this because I didn't want to risk breaking another stud.\r\n<h3 id=\"stepeight\">8. Put everything back together in reverse order<\/h3>\r\nNow that the new stud is on, put everything back together. Last but not least, <em>torque your lug nuts back on at 80 ft-lbs of torque, and no more!<\/em>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;

title: "4 Awesome Places You Must Visit in Costa Rica",
date: "2014-09-25 23:56:59"

Costa Rica has something for everyone, and has more to see than you'll likely have time for. I had the opportunity to visit a lot more than I would recommend anyone else visit in 2 short weeks, and I'll share with you a few of my favorites so you can plan your next trip a little better. This is in no way meant to be a complete guide, but you can use it to start your research and have an awesome time!\n\n<strong>1. Heredia<\/strong>\n\nHeredia is a small university town just north of the capital (San Jose). You'll find tons of urban shopping, good eats, and decent hotels - very different from the nature most people expect when they visit the country.\n\nI tried using <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lonelyplanet.com\/costa-rica\/central-valley-and-highlands\/heredia-area\/things-to-do\">Lonely Planet<\/a> for suggestions, but they're a hit or miss. Eat at Espigas for breakfast (you will never go wrong ordering Casado, which is their typical beans and rice dish with a protein and some fruit). Try their natural smoothies. One awesome thing about Latin America as a whole is the abundance of fresh, natural fruit and real fruit smoothies wherever you go - take advantage of the natural goodness. Skip the Cowboy Steakhouse if you actually like steak - it isn't really anything to brag about. You're better off trying something new and more typical Costa Rican. Go to the Parque Central, find a place to park (pay the parking guy if he's there) and explore the town. There is a swap-meet type of area on certain days, so you can buy souvenirs to take home. If you're lucky, a band will be there performing, so you can hang out, drink your smoothie and enjoy the people and atmosphere.\n\nAfter you've explored the city, set your GPS to visit the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.waterfallgardens.com\/\">La Paz Waterfall Gardens<\/a>. It's about an hour drive north of Heredia, and it's one of my favorite attractions in the entire country. It will cost you $38 per adult, and is worth every dollar. There you'll see more animals than you probably imagined ever seeing in Costa Rica. You can go into the aviary and hold &amp; feed toucans. You can go into the mariposario and surround yourself with exotic butterflies. If that's not enough, you can visit the big cats area and watch them feed pumas, ocelots, and jaguars in the afternoon - from just a few feet away! When you've had enough of the animals, you can continue on to the waterfall section, where you'll see breathtaking views of their several giant waterfalls. Watch out as you exit the park - coatimundis (pizotes) hang out near the garbage and like to raid it when the tourists aren't looking.\n\n<iframe src=\"\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Td2pf7ctmas?list=UUT0yn2f6dQI4QuCPxdf2N8g\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>\n<iframe src=\"\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/SEl0fQOOGXY?list=UUT0yn2f6dQI4QuCPxdf2N8g\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>\n\n<strong>2. Puerto Viejo<\/strong>\n\nA small Caribbean town on the east coast of the country, close to the border with Panama, Puerto Viejo is a good time and a half for tourists. You'll see tons of people from all over the world - some who have retired and live there, and others who are just passing through. You'll hear reggae music every few hundred meters, and will get to see a different side of Costa Rica that definitely has its own flavor.\n\nWhen you get to wherever you're staying, definitely get out and explore the town on foot. There are tons of places to buy souvenirs and crafts, and great restaurants to try out right on the main road. The vibe is really friendly, so you should even be safe walking around at night and catching some of the fun evening activities, like restaurants and bars with bands playing, and karaoke nights.\n\nDuring the day I'd recommend visiting the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jaguarrescue.com\/\">Jaguar Rescue Center<\/a>, which you'll need to drive or hitch a ride to. It's another one of the best places to see animals up close in Costa Rica, and shouldn't cost you more than $20. They have a great collection of venomous snakes, both types of sloths, anteaters and a few cats. They also have some local deer that, if they like you, will lick you to death. The best part is visiting the monkey area, where you'll have the opportunity to go inside the monkey habitat and play with some of the monkeys!\n\nFurther down the road is a chocolate tour, which you'll have to catch at a certain hour to do. You'll get a tour of the chocolate farm, and see the process of how chocolate is made. I wasn't lucky enough to make the tour, but at the store down front I bought some artisan chocolate and the guy was even nice enough to let me and my wife take a cacau fruit! If you haven't experienced that, you definitely need to take the tour. If they don't let you taste the cacau, beg them, bribe them, do whatever it takes to get one!\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Screen-Shot-2014-09-24-at-9.59.17-PM.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-48\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Screen-Shot-2014-09-24-at-9.59.17-PM-300x300.png\" alt=\"Two Toed Sloth in Puerto Viejo, Costa Rica\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a>\n\n<strong>3. Monteverde<\/strong>\n\nThis is a small town up in the mountains. The best thing to do here is to visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.selvatura.com\/\">Selvatura Park<\/a>, which deep in the dense rainforest. It rains a lot, and you may experience muddy roads on your way up, so drive safely and don't be in a rush. The temperature is also relatively low, with cool winds, so I'd recommend using a windbreaker (get a dark-colored one; I'll explain shortly).\n\nAt the park is one of the highest zipline attractions in the country. There are thirteen lines total, and the biggest one is 1 km long. The views are amazing, the experience is one-of-a-kind, and the people are super friendly. Don't make the mistake I made by wearing light-colored clothing, because the combination of rain and mud you'll go through as you hike up the course and get on the ziplines will have you filthy (my white hoodie is still soiled after tons of washes). You want your jacket to deflect the water and dirt, not absorb it!\n\nAfter the zipline tour, you can do the hanging bridge walk and take an opportunity to walk through the forest at your own pace. If you're lucky, you'll encounter exotic birds and maybe a pizote here and there.\n\nAlso in the area are night tours, which you can do through Selvatura as well. You might be exhausted by then, but if you want to see animals like sloths, snakes, frogs, porcupines and rodents in their natural habitat, the night tour might be worth it. Otherwise, rest up and get ready for the next day's adventure.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Screen-Shot-2014-09-24-at-10.00.08-PM.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-50\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Screen-Shot-2014-09-24-at-10.00.08-PM-300x300.png\" alt=\"Hanging Bridge in Selvatura Park, Costa Rica\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a>\n\n<strong>4. Arenal<\/strong>\n\nIf you're a driver, the road from Monteverde to Arenal I'd say is one of the funnest roads to drive in the country. There are certain stretches near the lake that are generally safe and well-kept, so you won't have to worry about hitting potholes. Be careful passing other drivers on the road, as it will be hard to see beyond the curves ahead of you.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Screen-Shot-2014-09-24-at-9.59.52-PM.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-49\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Screen-Shot-2014-09-24-at-9.59.52-PM-298x300.png\" alt=\"View from Hotel La Fortuna, Arenal, Costa Rica\" width=\"298\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a>\n\nWhen you get to Arenal, get settled in your hotel and get out of there. This is a small town at considerable elevation, situated near a large volcano called Arenal. If you're lucky, it won't be covered in clouds while you're there, and you'll get a chance to see it (I wasn't able to). If not, don't worry - there are tons of other things to do. Have some tasty local food, because in general it should be inexpensive and very good here. As with much of the country, you should be prepared for rain at all times - you don't want to get caught outside with nothing to cover up. Take some time to visit local shops and buy some nice souvenirs (I could have brought home a suitcase full of stuff from Arenal).\n\nBefore it gets dark, make sure you take some time to take the main road down to Tabac\u00f3n Hot Springs (assuming you don't have a resort with its own hot springs). Take it down about 15 minutes past all the resorts, and keep your eyes on the right side of the road. You'll see a yellow gate. Park on the side of the road and follow that small side-road past that gate. In a couple of minutes you'll find a flowing river of hot water! Depending on the time of day, there may be other people there. If it's crowded, just keep moving up the river until you find your spot. You definitely won't regret it.\n<iframe src=\"\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/hmySvdyZlws?list=UUT0yn2f6dQI4QuCPxdf2N8g\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>

title: "Fixing the valve cover leak on a 2004 Suzuki Forenza once and for all - gasket replacement",
date: "2014-11-13 01:01:10"
---

For a while now I've known my Forenza had an oil leak. My dad has tried at least once to fix it by changing the valve cover gasket, but was convinced Suzuki simply manufactured a crappy valve cover that leaked. Well, I got around to giving it another shot last weekend, and so far the valve cover does not leak. <!--more Read post-->\r\n\r\n<strong>If you've already done some research and\/or tried to fix yours, here's what the solution was: my dad read somewhere that putting gasket maker on both points of contact, being between the gasket and the valve cover, and between the gasket and the engine block, would do the trick. For some reason, that did not fix the oil leak. What I did differently was I put gasket maker only between the gasket and the valve cover, NOT on the engine block at all. So currently the gasket is directly seated onto the engine block, and so far it is not leaking at all.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nFor those who are replacing for the first time, I'll continue. Here's all you need:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>A 10mm wrench for the valve cover bolts<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Pliers to remove the hoses<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Gasket maker (I used black, though countless others recommend gray)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Replacement gasket (I bought an aftermarket one from eBay; didn't bother with OEM)<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nFirstly, note that you do not need to drain your oil before changing the valve cover gasket. When you're ready, start\u00a0removing the hoses attached to the cover. There should be two on the side facing the car, and one facing you.\r\n\r\nTake an allen wrench and pull off the top cover by unscrewing the two bolts on top. This will expose the other end of your spark plug wires. When it's off, it will look like this:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/IMG_0073.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-81 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/IMG_0073.jpg\" alt=\"Suzuki Forenza Valve Cover Replacement\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1536\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nTake note of the sequence of the spark plug wires (take a picture to be safe) before you pull them out. You will need to put them back in exactly the same order. Remove these wires and set them aside. If your valve cover leak is bad enough, you may have oil inside the spark plug wells, like mine. If you do, be ready to clean this out, because oil here will cause the cylinders to misfire.\r\n\r\nNext, remove the ten bolts holding the valve cover in place. Set these aside. This is what it will look like with the valve cover off.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/20150207_121732.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-82\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/20150207_121732.jpg\" alt=\"Suzuki Forenza Valve Cover Removed\" width=\"612\" height=\"816\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNow you've got some cleaning work to do. You want to clean both the engine block where your valve cover will have contact, as well as he valve cover. You can see mine in the video below, including what it looks like when you have applied gasket maker to the inside of the cover. At this point mine still had the gasket inside, that needed to be pulled out and then cleaned up.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/VAu0hNxrwiI\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\nOnce everything is all cleaned up, get your new gasket ready and open up that gasket maker. If this is your first time, you may want to try putting the gasket in dry so that you can see how it goes in. Go ahead and apply a thin line of gasket maker to the valve cover where the gasket will go. I did this one section at a time, so that the gasket maker wouldn't dry up on me before I was ready, but you\u00a0should be good with doing it all at once if you've got a steady hand. When you're done applying the gasket maker, press the gasket into the grooves, and clean up any gasket maker that oozes out.\r\n\r\nWhen you've got the engine block cleaned up where the gasket will seat, you're ready to place your valve cover back on. <strong>Important<\/strong>: if you did end up having oil in your spark plug wells, now would be a great time to clean it all out. I tried using a baster, but it didn't suck out all of the oil. I ended up using Q-tips to soak up the oil, and it got everything nice and dry. Also, make sure you don't let anything get into your engine while it is open. When ready, place the valve cover on and hand tighten the bolts back on. Now, there does exist a proper order to put the bolts back on, as well as a specific torque to torque them down, and of course, this is the way to go if you have the manual and want to do things 100% to the book. For the record, I did not consult the manual and put the bolts back on in a criss-cross fashion. After hand tightening the bolts, I tightened them down with a socket wrench and left them \"hand tight\". It is important that you do not overtighten these bolts as this could cause the valve cover to leak again. Get them tight, but not too tight, and you should be good.\r\n\r\nWhen you're done, put everything back together in reverse order, and you're finished! Let the gasket maker cure before you start the car up again. I let it sit for about 14 hours before I drove it again. Your valve cover should now be leak-free!

In all my recent commotion I came across a coupon for a free oil change at Meineke and figured, why not? They're a good-sized chain, and I should be able to trust them with something as minor as an oil change, right? Wrong. Come time to do my next oil change, I can't get the drain plug out because the last guy to put it back in overtorqued it. And I mean, he overtorqued it good - that thing isn't budging, and if I got it out, it probably wouldn't go back in again. Eventually, I'll probably end up trying to fix it, whether that means putting in a bigger plug or replacing the oil pan altogether, but for now I don't have the tools or the time. <!--more Read post-->\r\n\r\nAs a result, this past weekend I bought a hand pump to get the oil out of my dipstick hole. I didn't want to splurge, so I <a title=\"Autozome Fluid Transfer Pump\" href=\"http:\/\/www.autozone.com\/test-scan-and-specialty-tools\/fluid-pump\/oem-fluid-transfer-pump\/94647_0_0\/\" target=\"_blank\">went to Autozone and got a cheap one for $14.99<\/a>. It looks like this one below.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-70\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/1-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"Fluid Transfer Pump\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nI assembled the thing and put the intake hose into my dipstick hole, and the output hose in an oil draining pan. Then started pumping. First mistake: I actually set the hose on top of the draining pan, so when the first bit of oil came from out of my engine, it spurted all over the place. I ended up lightly stepping on the end of the hose to keep it in place.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately, I ran into a problem: the bigger intake hose kept collapsing, not allowing anything to enter the pump. This kept me pumping for over half an hour trying to get the oil out of my engine. This was enough to drive anyone insane. Luckily, the pump came with another hose for pumping air that is much thicker and doesn't collapse. When I pulled off the cheap orange hose and put that stronger hose on the intake, the oil came out a lot easier, though it still took a bit more time. Needless to say, when it comes time to do my oil change again, you can bet all the money you've got that I'm not using that cheap old pump again to get the job done.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/shopping.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-71 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/shopping.jpg\" alt=\"HT Moto Oil Extractor\" width=\"266\" height=\"186\" \/><\/a>This is the alternative I'm looking at for next time, though it's over $50 before shipping costs. <a title=\"Oil extractor pump video\" href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ZPflVUzVxJ8\" target=\"_blank\">According to this guy<\/a>, the hose on this one doesn't collapse like mine did, which is an absolute must if it's going to work out.

The new pump's hose is solid and does not collapse, allowing you to continuously pump without issues. It still took about 30-40 minutes to pump everything out, which is way longer than anyone wants to wait to get their oil changed. But, if you must go this route, do invest in the better pump. i will never again use the cheap pump to change my oil.

<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/20150127_170333.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-160 size-medium\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/20150127_170333-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"2015 Camry LE\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a> Just bought a 2015 Camry LE. Here was a recap of my experience, and a short review of driving it through extreme weather conditions in Dallas.\r\n\r\n<strong>The Buying Process<\/strong>\r\n\r\nI actually started off in the market for a new or lightly used Corolla, for the cheaper price. I figured it would do the job of being a decent family car, with few option requirements from me. I also figured I'd spend around $18,000 on a new one, or perhaps around $14,000 on a used. <!--more Read post-->Then I came across this post about <a title=\"Jalopnik article on the 2014 Corolla\" href=\"http:\/\/jalopnik.com\/how-toyota-screwed-up-the-2014-toyota-corolla-1187863687\" target=\"_blank\">how Toyota screwed up the 2014 Corolla<\/a> and was a bit turned off. The tipping point was finding a dealer offering $4,000 off MSRP on new Camrys, and I was swayed to the better-model Toyota.\r\n\r\nLet me back track a bit. I actually started off using TrueCar to see what the lowest price points were on Corollas. I grabbed 3 certificates for guaranteed prices from TrueCar, and got to work emailing the dealers, asking them to tell me why I should buy from them. Then, hearing about the Camry special, I transitioned over from Corolla haggling to Camry haggling. My offer started off as being, I'll buy today if you give me an out-the-door price of $20,000, flat. Of course, they wouldn't do it, seeing as final closing costs could bring the price as high as $24,000 and up for a base Camry. Going back and forth, I settled with the dealer (all via email, mind you) for $21.5 out-the-door.\r\n\r\nProblem is, that dealer was over an hour away from me. There was a Toyota dealer 5 minutes away, so you bet I took his quote to them and asked if they wanted to try and beat it. Long story short, I got out of there with a 2015 Camry at $21,750 out-the-door, with tinted windows and special mats (whatever). I believe I got a great deal, but if you know better, feel free to tell me I'm wrong!\r\n\r\n<strong>A month out, how is she driving?<\/strong>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_158\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/10885122_10152646968102093_5516020701960241268_n.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-158 size-medium\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/10885122_10152646968102093_5516020701960241268_n-300x202.jpg\" alt=\"Dallas Traffic during Sleetmaggedon\" width=\"300\" height=\"202\" \/><\/a> A map of how bad traffic and accidents got when the roads iced over.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe past couple of weeks has been hectic in Dallas, in terms of weather. We've faced two days of Sleetmaggedon, and another couple of days of snow and ice on the roads. Tons of accidents, tons of drivers getting stuck on the road. This turned into an excellent opportunity to test out the Camry's capabilities in poor conditions. I was interested in particular how the traction control would fare. I didn't stress test it by any means, but I was able to get a good feel for the Camry's normal driving limits.\r\n\r\nOut of 4 days driving through ice and snow, I felt the brakes lock once for about 2-3 seconds when cars in front of me suddenly stopped on the freeway. I kept my distance and was going about 35mph, so I had time to experience the lock, regain control and still stop the car well before it was too late. Traction control kicked in and helped me out pretty quickly, but it may not have been quick enough had I been going faster or been closer to the cars ahead of me. Apart from that incident, no other locking or slipping, apart from intentionally gunning it to feel it out. The only thing I don't like is how the traction control light flashes in bright red when it kicks in, and paying attention to it would seem to give someone an anxiety attack, rather than allow them to focus on regaining control. But I don't have a better solution for how that could be.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_161\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"225\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/20150227_100540.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-161 size-medium\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/20150227_100540-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"2015 Camry LE in the Snow\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a> Camry's first snow day.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe Camry also did well accelerating uphill in icy conditions, and did not lose traction at all. Rear wheel drive cars ahead of me were having trouble regaining traction after having stopped, but the good ol' Camry had no issues making it up whatsoever. The highest incline I went up was about 40% grade, which was enough to keep an old Tacoma and a Mustang ahead of me spinning helplessly. I flipped my signal and passed right on by in the next lane.\r\n\r\n<strong>New features - well, new to me<\/strong>\r\n\r\nWhen shopping, I was ready to tell the dealers to forget selling options to me, because I wasn't interested. I thought myself a simple guy who could do more with less. However, after you purchase, it's the little things that really make for a great experience. I'll only mention two things that I enjoy on my new Camry that I didn't have in my previous car. They aren't unique to it, but not all cars come equipped with them, either.\r\n\r\nFirst are the <strong>side mirror heaters<\/strong>. No better time to appreciate these than during the DFW sleet and snowstorms. Instead of having to work to free my mirrors of icy buildup, all I had to do was hit the button, wait a few minutes, and voila - the mirrors are clear. It seems like a small thing, but man is it impressive.\r\n\r\nSecond is the <strong>touch screen<\/strong> with blue tooth capability and the back up camera. Talking on the phone while driving is legal in Texas, but it's still not a good idea with all the loonies on the road. But with your phone connected to the car's blue tooth, talking and driving is a piece of cake. And that back up camera is nothing short of amazing when you're parallel parking and need to know how far away you are from the car behind you (that's really the only time I depend on it). Gone are the days when I needed my passenger to get out and direct me when trying to fit into a tight spot downtown. The camera helps you get it right every time.\r\n\r\n<strong>Conclusion<\/strong>\r\n\r\nOverall, I'm really happy with the purchase and would definitely go for the Camry as a reliable family car, every time. I plan to have the car 20 years or more, keeping up with regular maintenance and doing whatever repairs I need to as they come. They are easy to work on and inexpensive to maintain, and that's enough to keep me a Toyota fan for a very long time.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;

For a while now I've known my Forenza had an oil leak. My dad has tried at least once to fix it by changing the valve cover gasket, but was convinced Suzuki simply manufactured a crappy valve cover that leaked. Well, I got around to giving it another shot last weekend, and so far the valve cover does not leak.\r\n\r\n<strong>If you've already done some research and\/or tried to fix yours, here's what the solution was: my dad read somewhere that putting gasket maker on both points of contact, being between the gasket and the valve cover, and between the gasket and the engine block, would do the trick. For some reason, that did not fix the oil leak. What I did differently was I put gasket maker only between the gasket and the valve cover, NOT on the engine block at all. So currently the gasket is directly seated onto the engine block, and so far it is not leaking at all.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nFor those who are replacing for the first time, I'll continue. Here's all you need:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>A 10mm wrench for the valve cover bolts<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Pliers to remove the hoses<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Gasket maker (I used black, though countless others recommend gray)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Replacement gasket (I bought an aftermarket one from eBay; didn't bother with OEM)<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nFirstly, note that you do not need to drain your oil before changing the valve cover gasket. When you're ready, start\u00a0removing the hoses attached to the cover. There should be two on the side facing the car, and one facing you.\r\n\r\nTake an allen wrench and pull off the top cover by unscrewing the two bolts on top. This will expose the other end of your spark plug wires. When it's off, it will look like this:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/IMG_0073.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-81 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/IMG_0073.jpg\" alt=\"Suzuki Forenza Valve Cover Replacement\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1536\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nTake note of the sequence of the spark plug wires (take a picture to be safe) before you pull them out. You will need to put them back in exactly the same order. Remove these wires and set them aside. If your valve cover leak is bad enough, you may have oil inside the spark plug wells, like mine. If you do, be ready to clean this out, because oil here will cause the cylinders to misfire.\r\n\r\nNext, remove the ten bolts holding the valve cover in place. Set these aside. This is what it will look like with the valve cover off.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/20150207_121732.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-82\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/20150207_121732.jpg\" alt=\"Suzuki Forenza Valve Cover Removed\" width=\"612\" height=\"816\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNow you've got some cleaning work to do. You want to clean both the engine block where your valve cover will have contact, as well as he valve cover.

If this is your first time, you may want to try putting the gasket in dry so that you can see how it goes in. Go ahead and apply a thin line of gasket maker to the valve cover where the gasket will go. I did this one section at a time, so that the gasket maker wouldn't dry up on me before I was ready, but you\u00a0should be good with doing it all at once if you've got a steady hand. When you're done applying the gasket maker, press the gasket into the grooves, and clean up any gasket maker that oozes out.\r\n\r\nWhen you've got the engine block cleaned up where the gasket will seat, you're ready to place your valve cover back on. <strong>Important<\/strong>: if you did end up having oil in your spark plug wells, now would be a great time to clean it all out. I tried using a baster, but it didn't suck out all of the oil. I ended up using Q-tips to soak up the oil, and it got everything nice and dry. Also, make sure you don't let anything get into your engine while it is open. When ready, place the valve cover on and hand tighten the bolts back on. Now, there does exist a proper order to put the bolts back on, as well as a specific torque to torque them down, and of course, this is the way to go if you have the manual and want to do things 100% to the book. For the record, I did not consult the manual and put the bolts back on in a criss-cross fashion. After hand tightening the bolts, I tightened them down with a socket wrench and left them \"hand tight\". It is important that you do not overtighten these bolts as this could cause the valve cover to leak again. Get them tight, but not too tight, and you should be good.\r\n\r\nWhen you're done, put everything back together in reverse order, and you're finished! Let the gasket maker cure before you start the car up again. I let it sit for about 14 hours before I drove it again. Your valve cover should now be leak-free!

I'll start by saying that the caverns are a natural wonder that I completely underestimated, going into this trip. Much like standing over a high cliff overlooking a breathtaking view, the feeling you get while trying to take the caverns in through your senses is overwhelming. In short, they are a lot bigger than you can fathom before actually going in. <!--more Read post-->\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I don't have many pictures of the inside of the caverns, because the light from my phone's flash wasn't quite enough to capture a clear shot. If you intend to take pictures, do make sure you've got the right equipment.\r\n\r\nMy purpose here is to recount a few details of my experience, in hopes of helping you be prepared to also have a good experience.\r\n\r\n<strong>I brought my 4-month-old in a wearable infant carrier.<\/strong> Strollers aren't allowed in the caverns. Since she is under 3 years old, we weren't allowed to take any of the guided tours. We were only able to do the self-guided tour, and went through the Natural Entrance. She weights 12 pounds, and did not make the hike down any more difficult for me. Mind you, I am not exactly \"in shape\" in terms of cardio and endurance training, so I'm no extraordinary case. Also, it helped that at the end of the hike, you take an elevator back up to the surface, so there are no inclines to worry about.\r\n\r\nThe baby was quiet and observant almost the entire time. She only started to fuss a bit toward the end of our time in the cavern, so we stopped to give her some milk for about 15 minutes. She slept the rest of the way. If she was extremely noisy, I would have been a bit uncomfortable bringing her, because voice level is advised to be kept very low while inside due to the echo. Of course, on the self-guided tour people bring their kids, and those parents who don't control their kids (or don't have any control over their own voices) do spoil a few moments of the hike while they are near you. If they bother you, just let them pass or speed up.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_125\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"225\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/20150221_142717-e1425519179470.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-125 size-medium\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/20150221_142717-e1425519179470-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Feeding the baby inside Carlsbad Caverns, New Mexico\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a> Stopping to feed the fussy, hungry baby near the end of the self-guided tour.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>The temperature stays around 50 degrees Fahrenheit at all times, and does not change with the seasons.<\/strong> If that's too cold for you, I'd suggest bringing a sweater and wearing pants, as did my wife. I was fine in shorts and a t-shirt; I could feel the cold on my skin, but my body kept warm while hiking down. Once you get to the Big Room, there isn't much change in elevation and it did get a bit chilly for me. The baby had pants, socks, and a warm jacket.\r\n\r\n<strong>We brought two bottles of water and no food, and did fine.<\/strong> We spent maybe two and a half hours in the cavern, so consider that and how often you get hungry. Although, I am actually not sure if they allow food inside the caverns. I remember at least a caution not to leave food inside to prevent animals from being attracted. That being said, I doubt animals get very far inside the caverns. At the front of the Natural Entrance, there is a strong urine odor and scat along the path, which my wife identified as being left by coyotes (my wife is a wildlife biologist). Fun fact: according to her, they like to leave their business right in the middle of trails in a bold effort to tell you it's their territory. That only lasts the first 10 minutes or so of entering the cavern, and is completely absent after that.\r\n\r\n<strong>I brought a headlamp, because it gets really dark inside.<\/strong> There are lights set up inside to show some of the cavern features, which are awesome, because otherwise it would be completely dark inside. However, there are some areas along the path that are almost too dark to see where you are going. There aren't unexpected steps where you could trip and fall (the steps that are there have light pointed near them), but it is still nice to have some light to see where you are going.\r\n\r\n<strong>Wear a hat, or something to cover your head.<\/strong> As you may know, inside the caverns is a ton of moisture, which helps create the magnificent formations. To do this, the water has to drip! That means there will be water dripping from above on some parts of the path, and if you don't have something to cover your head, you may get wet. It isn't much, but could be a potential nuisance to some. I wore a baseball hat.\r\n\r\n<strong>The cost, like all national parks in the US (I believe) is $10 per adult.<\/strong> I know that doesn't matter to some, but I personally like to know costs up front before doing something.\r\n\r\n<strong>We stayed in the Hilton in Midland, Texas.<\/strong> It shortened our drive back to Dallas to 5 hours instead of 7-8, had we stayed in Carlsbad. That being said, I would not have stayed in Carlsbad even if the drive back didn't matter. The hotels are way overpriced (decent ones were in the $200+ range), and extremely unimpressive. The pictures I saw on TripAdvisor were in no way a true reflection of what some of the hotels actually looked like. My advice is to stick with a big name brand, for which you'll definitely pay the money - or better yet, drive 2 hours to El Paso and stay there or in a surrounding city instead. Carlsbad is one of those towns I wouldn't spend much time in unless I knew a local to take me around.\r\n\r\n<strong>There is food for sale in the visitor's center, before or after you see the caverns.<\/strong> Don't worry too much about bringing enough food. I can't tell you how the food is because we didn't eat there, but I did see things like sandwiches, at the very least, for sale near the elevator at the end of the tour.\r\n\r\n<strong>I wish we had spent more time in the area to visit nearby points of interest.<\/strong> After coming back home, friends told me about the <a title=\"White Sands National Monument on Google Maps\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/place\/White+Sands+National+Monument\" target=\"_blank\">White Sands National Monument<\/a>, <a title=\"Guadalupe Mountains on Google Maps\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/place\/Guadalupe+Mountains+National+Park\" target=\"_blank\">Guadalupe Mountains National Park<\/a>, and <a title=\"El Paso on Google Maps\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/place\/El+Paso\" target=\"_blank\">El Paso<\/a>, all of which I have not yet visited. If you've got the time, I'd suggest setting aside another day to go to one of these nearby places and turn an awesome trip into an epic one.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_120\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"3264\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/20150221_132736.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-120\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/20150221_132736.jpg\" alt=\"Natural Entrance, Carlsbad Caverns National Park, New Mexico\" width=\"3264\" height=\"2448\" \/><\/a> The view of the Natural Entrance from outside.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_121\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"2448\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/20150221_134436-e1425518957483.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-121 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/20150221_134436-e1425518957483.jpg\" alt=\"Whale's Mouth, Formation, Carlsbad Caverns, New Mexico\" width=\"2448\" height=\"3264\" \/><\/a> Whale's Mouth.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/20150221_135034.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-122\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/20150221_135034.jpg\" alt=\"Jasmyne inside the Cavern.\" width=\"3264\" height=\"2448\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/20150221_140247-e1425519046374.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-123\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/20150221_140247-e1425519046374.jpg\" alt=\"Andrew Delos Reyes at Carlsbad Cavern National Park, New Mexico\" width=\"2448\" height=\"3264\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_124\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"2448\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/20150221_150146-e1425519109762.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-124 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/20150221_150146-e1425519109762.jpg\" alt=\"Rock of Ages formation, Carlsbad Cavern National Park\" width=\"2448\" height=\"3264\" \/><\/a> \"Rock of Ages\" formation.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/BbbLm0H3trg\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>

A while back I was diagnosing an issue on my 2004 Suzuki Forenza and pulled code P0342, part of what was causing my check engine light to turn on. In short, I ended up ignoring the code because it wasn't what I was looking for at the time, and my car was running a little rough, but otherwise fine. Now about a week ago my car will turn over, but will not stay running for more than a half second. Lo and behold, the camshaft position sensor finally gave, and my car was stuck at my job's\u00a0parking lot. A big lesson learned, here. <!--more Read post-->\r\n\r\nI will cut right to the chase, because I already found a great post on this topic that sums up how to replace this sensor. You can find it <a title=\"Brian's Car Fix - Camshaft Position Sensor Replacement\" href=\"http:\/\/brianscarfix.blogspot.com\/2008\/06\/2004-suzuki-forenza-check-engine-light.html\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.\r\n\r\nIf you follow his instructions, you should be able to replace the sensor and get your car running again. However, there are a couple of issues I ran into that I want to mention in case anyone else runs into the same issues.\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>My engine mount would not come off, for any amount of effort I used to pull it loose. After removing the four nuts on top, I finally got it loose enough to yank off by raising and lowering the jack I used to support the engine. That did the trick. Image below to see what it looks like, and I also have it in a video <a title=\"Camshaft Position Sensor Video - 2004 Suzuki Forenza\" href=\"http:\/\/youtu.be\/eeH1pncUUBU\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_93\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"3264\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/20150225_120806.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-93 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/20150225_120806.jpg\" alt=\"2004 Suzuki Forenza Passenger Side Engine Mount\" width=\"3264\" height=\"2448\" \/><\/a> Passenger-side mount, that will need to come off so you can remove that metal plate and access the sensor screw.[\/caption]<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The plate between the mount and the timing cover pulls up and off - you do NOT need to remove the timing cover at all. This would have saved a lot of trouble if I had known beforehand. You don't need to remove the serpentine or the timing cover because what you need is only to remove that plate. Unscrew that bolt and pull up on it to remove it. (Of course, if for some reason you have a bad angle or have whatever other problem, you can unlatch the top of the timing cover and bend it down, but you do not need to remove it altogether.) Also, do not overtighten the bolt when putting this plate back on; mine snapped off inside the screw-hole very easily.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_108\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"3264\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/20150302_192042.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-108\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/20150302_192042.jpg\" alt=\"2004 Suzuki Forenza camshaft position sensor - plate cover\" width=\"3264\" height=\"2448\" \/><\/a> Metal plate covering the access to the cam sensor screw.[\/caption]<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The star-shaped screw is a pain to get to, so have your extension ready. There is a female-head screw below it that is somewhat blocked by a metal ring that holds the bolt outside the metal plate - it is NOT that screw. It is about 4 inches above it, at a harder-to-see angle (but much easier to get to). Images below. <strong>I strongly recommend that you have a magnetic pickup or something magnetic underneath it to catch the screw if\/when it loosens and falls.<\/strong> In my case, I had previously dropped a screwdriver bit in the timing case and had to stick a magnet tied to a zip-tie in there to get it out.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_107\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"3264\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/20150302_191830.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-107 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/20150302_191830.jpg\" alt=\"2004 Suzuki Forenza camshaft position sensor view\" width=\"3264\" height=\"2448\" \/><\/a> 2004 Suzuki Forenza camshaft position sensor close-up.

title: "Camshaft Position Sensor - Car Won't Start, 2004 Suzuki Forenza",
date: "2015-03-04 04:36:46"

A while back I was diagnosing an issue on my 2004 Suzuki Forenza and pulled code P0342, part of what was causing my check engine light to turn on. In short, I ended up ignoring the code because it wasn't what I was looking for at the time, and my car was running a little rough, but otherwise fine. Now about a week ago my car will turn over, but will not stay running for more than a half second. Lo and behold, the camshaft position sensor finally gave, and my car was stuck at my job's\u00a0parking lot. A big lesson learned, here.\r\n\r\nI will cut right to the chase, because I already found a great post on this topic that sums up how to replace this sensor. You can find it <a title=\"Brian's Car Fix - Camshaft Position Sensor Replacement\" href=\"http:\/\/brianscarfix.blogspot.com\/2008\/06\/2004-suzuki-forenza-check-engine-light.html\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.\r\n\r\nIf you follow his instructions, you should be able to replace the sensor and get your car running again. However, there are a couple of issues I ran into that I want to mention in case anyone else runs into the same issues.\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>My engine mount would not come off, for any amount of effort I used to pull it loose.

title: "Changing my car's oil with a fluid extractor pump",
date: "2015-03-04 04:37:09"
---

In all my recent commotion I came across a coupon for a free oil change at Meineke and figured, why not? They're a good-sized chain, and I should be able to trust them with something as minor as an oil change, right? Wrong. Come time to do my next oil change, I can't get the drain plug out because the last guy to put it back in overtorqued it. And I mean, he overtorqued it good - that thing isn't budging, and if I got it out, it probably wouldn't go back in again. Eventually, I'll probably end up trying to fix it, whether that means putting in a bigger plug or replacing the oil pan altogether, but for now I don't have the tools or the time.\n\nAs a result, this past weekend I bought a hand pump to get the oil out of my dipstick hole. I didn't want to splurge, so I <a title=\"Autozome Fluid Transfer Pump\" href=\"http:\/\/www.autozone.com\/test-scan-and-specialty-tools\/fluid-pump\/oem-fluid-transfer-pump\/94647_0_0\/\" target=\"_blank\">went to Autozone and got a cheap one for $14.99<\/a>. It looks like this one below.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-70\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/1-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"Fluid Transfer Pump\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a>\n\nI assembled the thing and put the intake hose into my dipstick hole, and the output hose in an oil draining pan. Then started pumping. First mistake: I actually set the hose on top of the draining pan, so when the first bit of oil came from out of my engine, it spurted all over the place. I ended up lightly stepping on the end of the hose to keep it in place.\n\nAlmost immediately, I ran into a problem: the bigger intake hose kept collapsing, not allowing anything to enter the pump. This kept me pumping for over half an hour trying to get the oil out of my engine. This was enough to drive anyone insane. Luckily, the pump came with another hose for pumping air that is much thicker and doesn't collapse. When I pulled off the cheap orange hose and put that stronger hose on the intake, the oil came out a lot easier, though it still took a bit more time. Needless to say, when it comes time to do my oil change again, you can bet all the money you've got that I'm not using that cheap old pump again to get the job done.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/shopping.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-71\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/shopping.jpg\" alt=\"HT Moto Oil Extractor\" width=\"266\" height=\"186\" \/><\/a>\n\nThis is the alternative I'm looking at for next time, though it's over $50 before shipping costs. <a title=\"Oil extractor pump video\" href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ZPflVUzVxJ8\" target=\"_blank\">According to this guy<\/a>, the hose on this one doesn't collapse like mine did, which is an absolute must if it's going to work out. Although I probably could get it done with that other hose on my cheap pump, I'd prefer having a semi-transparent tank so I can see how much oil I've taken out much easier.\n\nMoral of the story? One, don't be lazy and do your own oil changes. Two, you definitely get what you pay for, so get the better tool if you don't want to end up doing extra work (or spending the money in the end, anyway).\n\n<strong>UPDATE<\/strong>: After changing my oil with the new pump, mentioned above, the difference is night from day. The new pump's hose is solid and does not collapse, allowing you to continuously pump without issues. It still took about 30-40 minutes to pump everything out, which is way longer than anyone wants to wait to get their oil changed. But, if you must go this route, do invest in the better pump. i will never again use the cheap pump to change my oil.

Since she is under 3 years old, we weren't allowed to take any of the guided tours. We were only able to do the self-guided tour, and went through the Natural Entrance. She weights 12 pounds, and did not make the hike down any more difficult for me. Mind you, I am not exactly \"in shape\" in terms of cardio and endurance training, so I'm no extraordinary case.

If she was extremely noisy, I would have been a bit uncomfortable bringing her, because voice level is advised to be kept very low while inside due to the echo. Of course, on the self-guided tour people bring their kids, and those parents who don't control their kids (or don't have any control over their own voices) do spoil a few moments of the hike while they are near you. If they bother you, just let them pass or speed up.\r\n\r\n<strong>The temperature stays around 50 degrees Fahrenheit at all times, and does not change with the seasons.<\/strong> If that's too cold for you, I'd suggest bringing a sweater and wearing pants, as did my wife.

Although, I am actually not sure if they allow food inside the caverns. I remember at least a caution not to leave food inside to prevent animals from being attracted. That being said, I doubt animals get very far inside the caverns.

A couple of weekends ago I took my wife and daughter to Carlsbad, New Mexico to visit the Caverns. I'll start by saying that the caverns are a natural wonder that I completely underestimated, going into this trip. Much like standing over a high cliff overlooking a breathtaking view, the feeling you get while trying to take the caverns in through your senses is overwhelming. In short, they are a lot bigger than you can fathom before actually going in.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I don't have many pictures of the inside of the caverns, because the light from my phone's flash wasn't quite enough to capture a clear shot. If you intend to take pictures, do make sure you've got the right equipment.\r\n\r\nMy purpose here is to recount a few details of my experience, in hopes of helping you be prepared to also have a good experience.\r\n\r\n<strong>I brought my 4-month-old in a wearable infant carrier.<\/strong> Strollers aren't allowed in the caverns. Since she is under 3 years old, we weren't allowed to take any of the guided tours. We were only able to do the self-guided tour, and went through the Natural Entrance. She weights 12 pounds, and did not make the hike down any more difficult for me. Mind you, I am not exactly \"in shape\" in terms of cardio and endurance training, so I'm no extraordinary case. Also, it helped that at the end of the hike, you take an elevator back up to the surface, so there are no inclines to worry about.\r\n\r\nThe baby was quiet and observant almost the entire time. She only started to fuss a bit toward the end of our time in the cavern, so we stopped to give her some milk for about 15 minutes. She slept the rest of the way. If she was extremely noisy, I would have been a bit uncomfortable bringing her, because voice level is advised to be kept very low while inside due to the echo. Of course, on the self-guided tour people bring their kids, and those parents who don't control their kids (or don't have any control over their own voices) do spoil a few moments of the hike while they are near you. If they bother you, just let them pass or speed up.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_125\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"2448\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/20150221_142717-e1425519179470.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-125\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/20150221_142717-e1425519179470.jpg\" alt=\"Feeding the baby inside Carlsbad Caverns, New Mexico\" width=\"2448\" height=\"3264\" \/><\/a> Stopping to feed the fussy, hungry baby near the end of the self-guided tour.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>The temperature stays around 50 degrees Fahrenheit at all times, and does not change with the seasons.<\/strong> If that's too cold for you, I'd suggest bringing a sweater and wearing pants, as did my wife.

I'll start by saying that the caverns are a natural wonder that I completely underestimated, going into this trip. Much like standing over a high cliff overlooking a breathtaking view, the feeling you get while trying to take the caverns in through your senses is overwhelming. In short, they are a lot bigger than you can fathom before actually going in.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I don't have many pictures of the inside of the caverns, because the light from my phone's flash wasn't quite enough to capture a clear shot. If you intend to take pictures, do make sure you've got the right equipment.\r\n\r\nMy purpose here is to recount a few details of my experience, in hopes of helping you be prepared to also have a good experience.\r\n\r\n<strong>I brought my 4-month-old in a wearable infant carrier.<\/strong> Strollers aren't allowed in the caverns. Since she is under 3 years old, we weren't allowed to take any of the guided tours. We were only able to do the self-guided tour, and went through the Natural Entrance. She weights 12 pounds, and did not make the hike down any more difficult for me. Mind you, I am not exactly \"in shape\" in terms of cardio and endurance training, so I'm no extraordinary case. Also, it helped that at the end of the hike, you take an elevator back up to the surface, so there are no inclines to worry about.\r\n\r\nThe baby was quiet and observant almost the entire time. She only started to fuss a bit toward the end of our time in the cavern, so we stopped to give her some milk for about 15 minutes. She slept the rest of the way. If she was extremely noisy, I would have been a bit uncomfortable bringing her, because voice level is advised to be kept very low while inside due to the echo. Of course, on the self-guided tour people bring their kids, and those parents who don't control their kids (or don't have any control over their own voices) do spoil a few moments of the hike while they are near you. If they bother you, just let them pass or speed up.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_125\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"225\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/20150221_142717-e1425519179470.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-125 size-medium\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/20150221_142717-e1425519179470-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Feeding the baby inside Carlsbad Caverns, New Mexico\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a> Stopping to feed the fussy, hungry baby near the end of the self-guided tour.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>The temperature stays around 50 degrees Fahrenheit at all times, and does not change with the seasons.<\/strong> If that's too cold for you, I'd suggest bringing a sweater and wearing pants, as did my wife.

That being said, I doubt animals get very far inside the caverns. At the front of the Natural Entrance, there is a strong urine odor and scat along the path, which my wife identified as being left by coyotes (my wife is a wildlife biologist).

I'll start by saying that the caverns are a natural wonder that I completely underestimated, going into this trip.

In short, they are a lot bigger than you can fathom before actually going in.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I don't have many pictures of the inside of the caverns, because the light from my phone's flash wasn't quite enough to capture a clear shot.

Since she is under 3 years old, we weren't allowed to take any of the guided tours. We were only able to do the self-guided tour, and went through the Natural Entrance. She weights 12 pounds, and did not make the hike down any more difficult for me. Mind you, I am not exactly \"in shape\" in terms of cardio and endurance training, so I'm no extraordinary case. Also, it helped that at the end of the hike, you take an elevator back up to the surface, so there are no inclines to worry about.\r\n\r\nThe baby was quiet and observant almost the entire time. She only started to fuss a bit toward the end of our time in the cavern, so we stopped to give her some milk for about 15 minutes. She slept the rest of the way. If she was extremely noisy, I would have been a bit uncomfortable bringing her, because voice level is advised to be kept very low while inside due to the echo. Of course, on the self-guided tour people bring their kids, and those parents who don't control their kids (or don't have any control over their own voices) do spoil a few moments of the hike while they are near you.

Although, I am actually not sure if they allow food inside the caverns. I remember at least a caution not to leave food inside to prevent animals from being attracted. That being said, I doubt animals get very far inside the caverns. At the front of the Natural Entrance, there is a strong urine odor and scat along the path, which my wife identified as being left by coyotes (my wife is a wildlife biologist).

I'll start by saying that the caverns are a natural wonder that I completely underestimated, going into this trip. Much like standing over a high cliff overlooking a breathtaking view, the feeling you get while trying to take the caverns in through your senses is overwhelming. In short, they are a lot bigger than you can fathom before actually going in. <!--more Read post-->\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I don't have many pictures of the inside of the caverns, because the light from my phone's flash wasn't quite enough to capture a clear shot. If you intend to take pictures, do make sure you've got the right equipment.\r\n\r\nMy purpose here is to recount a few details of my experience, in hopes of helping you be prepared to also have a good experience.\r\n\r\n<strong>I brought my 4-month-old in a wearable infant carrier.<\/strong> Strollers aren't allowed in the caverns. Since she is under 3 years old, we weren't allowed to take any of the guided tours. We were only able to do the self-guided tour, and went through the Natural Entrance. She weights 12 pounds, and did not make the hike down any more difficult for me. Mind you, I am not exactly \"in shape\" in terms of cardio and endurance training, so I'm no extraordinary case. Also, it helped that at the end of the hike, you take an elevator back up to the surface, so there are no inclines to worry about.\r\n\r\nThe baby was quiet and observant almost the entire time. She only started to fuss a bit toward the end of our time in the cavern, so we stopped to give her some milk for about 15 minutes. She slept the rest of the way. If she was extremely noisy, I would have been a bit uncomfortable bringing her, because voice level is advised to be kept very low while inside due to the echo. Of course, on the self-guided tour people bring their kids, and those parents who don't control their kids (or don't have any control over their own voices) do spoil a few moments of the hike while they are near you. If they bother you, just let them pass or speed up.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_125\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"225\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/20150221_142717-e1425519179470.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-125 size-medium\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/20150221_142717-e1425519179470-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Feeding the baby inside Carlsbad Caverns, New Mexico\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a> Stopping to feed the fussy, hungry baby near the end of the self-guided tour.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>The temperature stays around 50 degrees Fahrenheit at all times, and does not change with the seasons.<\/strong> If that's too cold for you, I'd suggest bringing a sweater and wearing pants, as did my wife. I was fine in shorts and a t-shirt; I could feel the cold on my skin, but my body kept warm while hiking down. Once you get to the Big Room, there isn't much change in elevation and it did get a bit chilly for me. The baby had pants, socks, and a warm jacket.\r\n\r\n<strong>We brought two bottles of water and no food, and did fine.<\/strong> We spent maybe two and a half hours in the cavern, so consider that and how often you get hungry. Although, I am actually not sure if they allow food inside the caverns. I remember at least a caution not to leave food inside to prevent animals from being attracted. That being said, I doubt animals get very far inside the caverns. At the front of the Natural Entrance, there is a strong urine odor and scat along the path, which my wife identified as being left by coyotes (my wife is a wildlife biologist). Fun fact: according to her, they like to leave their business right in the middle of trails in a bold effort to tell you it's their territory. That only lasts the first 10 minutes or so of entering the cavern, and is completely absent after that.\r\n\r\n<strong>I brought a headlamp, because it gets really dark inside.<\/strong> There are lights set up inside to show some of the cavern features, which are awesome, because otherwise it would be completely dark inside. However, there are some areas along the path that are almost too dark to see where you are going. There aren't unexpected steps where you could trip and fall (the steps that are there have light pointed near them), but it is still nice to have some light to see where you are going.\r\n\r\n<strong>Wear a hat, or something to cover your head.<\/strong> As you may know, inside the caverns is a ton of moisture, which helps create the magnificent formations. To do this, the water has to drip! That means there will be water dripping from above on some parts of the path, and if you don't have something to cover your head, you may get wet. It isn't much, but could be a potential nuisance to some. I wore a baseball hat.\r\n\r\n<strong>The cost, like all national parks in the US (I believe) is $10 per adult.<\/strong> I know that doesn't matter to some, but I personally like to know costs up front before doing something.\r\n\r\n<strong>We stayed in the Hilton in Midland, Texas.<\/strong> It shortened our drive back to Dallas to 5 hours instead of 7-8, had we stayed in Carlsbad. That being said, I would not have stayed in Carlsbad even if the drive back didn't matter. The hotels are way overpriced (decent ones were in the $200+ range), and extremely unimpressive. The pictures I saw on TripAdvisor were in no way a true reflection of what some of the hotels actually looked like. My advice is to stick with a big name brand, for which you'll definitely pay the money - or better yet, drive 2 hours to El Paso and stay there or in a surrounding city instead. Carlsbad is one of those towns I wouldn't spend much time in unless I knew a local to take me around.\r\n\r\n<strong>There is food for sale in the visitor's center, before or after you see the caverns.<\/strong> Don't worry too much about bringing enough food. I can't tell you how the food is because we didn't eat there, but I did see things like sandwiches, at the very least, for sale near the elevator at the end of the tour.\r\n\r\n<strong>I wish we had spent more time in the area to visit nearby points of interest.<\/strong> After coming back home, friends told me about the <a title=\"White Sands National Monument on Google Maps\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/place\/White+Sands+National+Monument\" target=\"_blank\">White Sands National Monument<\/a>, <a title=\"Guadalupe Mountains on Google Maps\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/place\/Guadalupe+Mountains+National+Park\" target=\"_blank\">Guadalupe Mountains National Park<\/a>, and <a title=\"El Paso on Google Maps\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/place\/El+Paso\" target=\"_blank\">El Paso<\/a>, all of which I have not yet visited.

A while back I was diagnosing an issue on my 2004 Suzuki Forenza and pulled code P0342, part of what was causing my check engine light to turn on. In short, I ended up ignoring the code because it wasn't what I was looking for at the time, and my car was running a little rough, but otherwise fine. Now about a week ago my car will turn over, but will not stay running for more than a half second. Lo and behold, the camshaft position sensor finally gave, and my car was stuck at my job's\u00a0parking lot. A big lesson learned, here. <!--more Read the post-->\r\n\r\nI will cut right to the chase, because I already found a great post on this topic that sums up how to replace this sensor.

title: "Fixing the valve cover leak on a 2004 Suzuki Forenza once and for all - gasket replacement",
date: "2015-03-05 04:29:20"
---

For a while now I've known my Forenza had an oil leak. My dad has tried at least once to fix it by changing the valve cover gasket, but was convinced Suzuki simply manufactured a crappy valve cover that leaked. Well, I got around to giving it another shot last weekend, and so far the valve cover does not leak. <!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>If you've already done some research and\/or tried to fix yours, here's what the solution was: my dad read somewhere that putting gasket maker on both points of contact, being between the gasket and the valve cover, and between the gasket and the engine block, would do the trick. For some reason, that did not fix the oil leak. What I did differently was I put gasket maker only between the gasket and the valve cover, NOT on the engine block at all. So currently the gasket is directly seated onto the engine block, and so far it is not leaking at all.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nFor those who are replacing for the first time, I'll continue. Here's all you need:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>A 10mm wrench for the valve cover bolts<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Pliers to remove the hoses<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Gasket maker (I used black, though countless others recommend gray)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Replacement gasket (I bought an aftermarket one from eBay; didn't bother with OEM)<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nFirstly, note that you do not need to drain your oil before changing the valve cover gasket. When you're ready, start\u00a0removing the hoses attached to the cover. There should be two on the side facing the car, and one facing you.\r\n\r\nTake an allen wrench and pull off the top cover by unscrewing the two bolts on top. This will expose the other end of your spark plug wires. When it's off, it will look like this:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/IMG_0073.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-81 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/IMG_0073.jpg\" alt=\"Suzuki Forenza Valve Cover Replacement\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1536\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nTake note of the sequence of the spark plug wires (take a picture to be safe) before you pull them out. You will need to put them back in exactly the same order. Remove these wires and set them aside. If your valve cover leak is bad enough, you may have oil inside the spark plug wells, like mine. If you do, be ready to clean this out, because oil here will cause the cylinders to misfire.\r\n\r\nNext, remove the ten bolts holding the valve cover in place. Set these aside. This is what it will look like with the valve cover off.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/20150207_121732.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-82\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/20150207_121732.jpg\" alt=\"Suzuki Forenza Valve Cover Removed\" width=\"612\" height=\"816\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNow you've got some cleaning work to do. You want to clean both the engine block where your valve cover will have contact, as well as he valve cover. You can see mine in the video below, including what it looks like when you have applied gasket maker to the inside of the cover. At this point mine still had the gasket inside, that needed to be pulled out and then cleaned up.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/VAu0hNxrwiI\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\nOnce everything is all cleaned up, get your new gasket ready and open up that gasket maker. If this is your first time, you may want to try putting the gasket in dry so that you can see how it goes in. Go ahead and apply a thin line of gasket maker to the valve cover where the gasket will go. I did this one section at a time, so that the gasket maker wouldn't dry up on me before I was ready, but you\u00a0should be good with doing it all at once if you've got a steady hand. When you're done applying the gasket maker, press the gasket into the grooves, and clean up any gasket maker that oozes out.\r\n\r\nWhen you've got the engine block cleaned up where the gasket will seat, you're ready to place your valve cover back on. <strong>Important<\/strong>: if you did end up having oil in your spark plug wells, now would be a great time to clean it all out. I tried using a baster, but it didn't suck out all of the oil. I ended up using Q-tips to soak up the oil, and it got everything nice and dry. Also, make sure you don't let anything get into your engine while it is open. When ready, place the valve cover on and hand tighten the bolts back on. Now, there does exist a proper order to put the bolts back on, as well as a specific torque to torque them down, and of course, this is the way to go if you have the manual and want to do things 100% to the book. For the record, I did not consult the manual and put the bolts back on in a criss-cross fashion. After hand tightening the bolts, I tightened them down with a socket wrench and left them \"hand tight\". It is important that you do not overtighten these bolts as this could cause the valve cover to leak again. Get them tight, but not too tight, and you should be good.\r\n\r\nWhen you're done, put everything back together in reverse order, and you're finished! Let the gasket maker cure before you start the car up again. I let it sit for about 14 hours before I drove it again. Your valve cover should now be leak-free!

title: "Changing my car's oil with a fluid extractor pump",
date: "2015-03-05 04:30:24"
---

In all my recent commotion I came across a coupon for a free oil change at Meineke and figured, why not? They're a good-sized chain, and I should be able to trust them with something as minor as an oil change, right? Wrong. Come time to do my next oil change, I can't get the drain plug out because the last guy to put it back in overtorqued it. And I mean, he overtorqued it good - that thing isn't budging, and if I got it out, it probably wouldn't go back in again. Eventually, I'll probably end up trying to fix it, whether that means putting in a bigger plug or replacing the oil pan altogether, but for now I don't have the tools or the time. <!--more Read post-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a result, this past weekend I bought a hand pump to get the oil out of my dipstick hole. I didn't want to splurge, so I <a title=\"Autozome Fluid Transfer Pump\" href=\"http:\/\/www.autozone.com\/test-scan-and-specialty-tools\/fluid-pump\/oem-fluid-transfer-pump\/94647_0_0\/\" target=\"_blank\">went to Autozone and got a cheap one for $14.99<\/a>. It looks like this one below.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-70\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/1-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"Fluid Transfer Pump\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nI assembled the thing and put the intake hose into my dipstick hole, and the output hose in an oil draining pan. Then started pumping. First mistake: I actually set the hose on top of the draining pan, so when the first bit of oil came from out of my engine, it spurted all over the place. I ended up lightly stepping on the end of the hose to keep it in place.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately, I ran into a problem: the bigger intake hose kept collapsing, not allowing anything to enter the pump. This kept me pumping for over half an hour trying to get the oil out of my engine. This was enough to drive anyone insane. Luckily, the pump came with another hose for pumping air that is much thicker and doesn't collapse. When I pulled off the cheap orange hose and put that stronger hose on the intake, the oil came out a lot easier, though it still took a bit more time. Needless to say, when it comes time to do my oil change again, you can bet all the money you've got that I'm not using that cheap old pump again to get the job done.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/shopping.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-71\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/shopping.jpg\" alt=\"HT Moto Oil Extractor\" width=\"266\" height=\"186\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nThis is the alternative I'm looking at for next time, though it's over $50 before shipping costs. <a title=\"Oil extractor pump video\" href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ZPflVUzVxJ8\" target=\"_blank\">According to this guy<\/a>, the hose on this one doesn't collapse like mine did, which is an absolute must if it's going to work out. Although I probably could get it done with that other hose on my cheap pump, I'd prefer having a semi-transparent tank so I can see how much oil I've taken out much easier.\r\n\r\nMoral of the story? One, don't be lazy and do your own oil changes. Two, you definitely get what you pay for, so get the better tool if you don't want to end up doing extra work (or spending the money in the end, anyway).\r\n\r\n<strong>UPDATE<\/strong>: After changing my oil with the new pump, mentioned above, the difference is night from day. The new pump's hose is solid and does not collapse, allowing you to continuously pump without issues. It still took about 30-40 minutes to pump everything out, which is way longer than anyone wants to wait to get their oil changed. But, if you must go this route, do invest in the better pump. i will never again use the cheap pump to change my oil.

title: "4 Awesome Places You Must Visit in Costa Rica",
date: "2015-03-05 04:30:48"

Costa Rica has something for everyone, and has more to see than you'll likely have time for. I had the opportunity to visit a lot more than I would recommend anyone else visit in 2 short weeks, and I'll share with you a few of my favorites so you can plan your next trip a little better. This is in no way meant to be a complete guide, but you can use it to start your research and have an awesome time! <!--more Read post-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>1. Heredia<\/strong>\r\n\r\nHeredia is a small university town just north of the capital (San Jose). You'll find tons of urban shopping, good eats, and decent hotels - very different from the nature most people expect when they visit the country.\r\n\r\nI tried using <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lonelyplanet.com\/costa-rica\/central-valley-and-highlands\/heredia-area\/things-to-do\">Lonely Planet<\/a> for suggestions, but they're a hit or miss. Eat at Espigas for breakfast (you will never go wrong ordering Casado, which is their typical beans and rice dish with a protein and some fruit). Try their natural smoothies. One awesome thing about Latin America as a whole is the abundance of fresh, natural fruit and real fruit smoothies wherever you go - take advantage of the natural goodness. Skip the Cowboy Steakhouse if you actually like steak - it isn't really anything to brag about. You're better off trying something new and more typical Costa Rican. Go to the Parque Central, find a place to park (pay the parking guy if he's there) and explore the town. There is a swap-meet type of area on certain days, so you can buy souvenirs to take home. If you're lucky, a band will be there performing, so you can hang out, drink your smoothie and enjoy the people and atmosphere.\r\n\r\nAfter you've explored the city, set your GPS to visit the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.waterfallgardens.com\/\">La Paz Waterfall Gardens<\/a>. It's about an hour drive north of Heredia, and it's one of my favorite attractions in the entire country. It will cost you $38 per adult, and is worth every dollar. There you'll see more animals than you probably imagined ever seeing in Costa Rica. You can go into the aviary and hold &amp; feed toucans. You can go into the mariposario and surround yourself with exotic butterflies. If that's not enough, you can visit the big cats area and watch them feed pumas, ocelots, and jaguars in the afternoon - from just a few feet away! When you've had enough of the animals, you can continue on to the waterfall section, where you'll see breathtaking views of their several giant waterfalls. Watch out as you exit the park - coatimundis (pizotes) hang out near the garbage and like to raid it when the tourists aren't looking.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Td2pf7ctmas?list=UUT0yn2f6dQI4QuCPxdf2N8g\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>\r\n<iframe src=\"\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/SEl0fQOOGXY?list=UUT0yn2f6dQI4QuCPxdf2N8g\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\n<strong>2. Puerto Viejo<\/strong>\r\n\r\nA small Caribbean town on the east coast of the country, close to the border with Panama, Puerto Viejo is a good time and a half for tourists. You'll see tons of people from all over the world - some who have retired and live there, and others who are just passing through. You'll hear reggae music every few hundred meters, and will get to see a different side of Costa Rica that definitely has its own flavor.\r\n\r\nWhen you get to wherever you're staying, definitely get out and explore the town on foot. There are tons of places to buy souvenirs and crafts, and great restaurants to try out right on the main road. The vibe is really friendly, so you should even be safe walking around at night and catching some of the fun evening activities, like restaurants and bars with bands playing, and karaoke nights.\r\n\r\nDuring the day I'd recommend visiting the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jaguarrescue.com\/\">Jaguar Rescue Center<\/a>, which you'll need to drive or hitch a ride to. It's another one of the best places to see animals up close in Costa Rica, and shouldn't cost you more than $20. They have a great collection of venomous snakes, both types of sloths, anteaters and a few cats. They also have some local deer that, if they like you, will lick you to death. The best part is visiting the monkey area, where you'll have the opportunity to go inside the monkey habitat and play with some of the monkeys!<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Screen-Shot-2014-09-24-at-9.59.17-PM.png\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-48 size-medium\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Screen-Shot-2014-09-24-at-9.59.17-PM-300x300.png\" alt=\"Two Toed Sloth in Puerto Viejo, Costa Rica\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nFurther down the road is a <a href=\"http:\/\/caribeanscr.com\/chocolate-tour.html\">chocolate tour<\/a>, which you'll have to catch at a certain hour to do. You'll get a tour of the chocolate farm, and see the process of how chocolate is made. I wasn't lucky enough to make the tour, but at the store down front I bought some artisan chocolate and the guy was even nice enough to let me and my wife take a cacau fruit! If you haven't experienced that, you definitely need to take the tour. If they don't let you taste the cacau, beg them, bribe them, do whatever it takes to get one!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>3. Monteverde<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThis is a small town up in the mountains. The best thing to do here is to visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.selvatura.com\/\">Selvatura Park<\/a>, which deep in the dense rainforest. It rains a lot, and you may experience muddy roads on your way up, so drive safely and don't be in a rush. The temperature is also relatively low, with cool winds, so I'd recommend using a windbreaker (get a dark-colored one; I'll explain shortly).\r\n\r\nAt the park is one of the highest zipline attractions in the country. There are thirteen lines total, and the biggest one is 1 km long. The views are amazing, the experience is one-of-a-kind, and the people are super friendly. Don't make the mistake I made by wearing light-colored clothing, because the combination of rain and mud you'll go through as you hike up the course and get on the ziplines will have you filthy (my white hoodie is still soiled after tons of washes). You want your jacket to deflect the water and dirt, not absorb it!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Screen-Shot-2014-09-24-at-10.00.08-PM.png\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-50 size-medium\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Screen-Shot-2014-09-24-at-10.00.08-PM-300x300.png\" alt=\"Hanging Bridge in Selvatura Park, Costa Rica\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a>After the zipline tour, you can do the hanging bridge walk and take an opportunity to walk through the forest at your own pace. If you're lucky, you'll encounter exotic birds and maybe a pizote here and there.\r\n\r\nAlso in the area are night tours, which you can do through Selvatura as well. You might be exhausted by then, but if you want to see animals like sloths, snakes, frogs, porcupines and rodents in their natural habitat, the night tour might be worth it. Otherwise, rest up and get ready for the next day's adventure.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>4. Arenal<\/strong>\r\n\r\nIf you're a driver, the road from Monteverde to Arenal I'd say is one of the funnest roads to drive in the country. There are certain stretches near the lake that are generally safe and well-kept, so you won't have to worry about hitting potholes. Be careful passing other drivers on the road, as it will be hard to see beyond the curves ahead of you.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Screen-Shot-2014-09-24-at-9.59.52-PM.png\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-49 size-medium\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Screen-Shot-2014-09-24-at-9.59.52-PM-298x300.png\" alt=\"View from Hotel La Fortuna, Arenal, Costa Rica\" width=\"298\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a>When you get to Arenal, get settled in your hotel and get out of there. This is a small town at considerable elevation, situated near a large volcano called Arenal. If you're lucky, it won't be covered in clouds while you're there, and you'll get a chance to see it (I wasn't able to). If not, don't worry - there are tons of other things to do. Have some tasty local food, because in general it should be inexpensive and very good here. As with much of the country, you should be prepared for rain at all times - you don't want to get caught outside with nothing to cover up. Take some time to visit local shops and buy some nice souvenirs (I could have brought home a suitcase full of stuff from Arenal).\r\n\r\nBefore it gets dark, make sure you take some time to take the main road down to Tabac\u00f3n Hot Springs (assuming you don't have a resort with its own hot springs). Take it down about 15 minutes past all the resorts, and keep your eyes on the right side of the road. You'll see a yellow gate. Park on the side of the road and follow that small side-road past that gate. In a couple of minutes you'll find a flowing river of hot water! Depending on the time of day, there may be other people there. If it's crowded, just keep moving up the river until you find your spot. You definitely won't regret it.\r\n<iframe src=\"\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/hmySvdyZlws?list=UUT0yn2f6dQI4QuCPxdf2N8g\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>

title: "3 Ways You'll Lose Your Money in Costa Rica",
date: "2015-03-06 01:18:44"
---

Planning on visiting one of the most internationally popular, well-spoken-of country in Central America? You won't have your dream vacation without paying for it. Here are a few ways the country will take money out of your pocket when you aren't expecting it. <!--more Read post-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>1. Your rental car will cost you way more than you think.\r\n<\/strong>\r\n\r\nSo be sure to plan this part at the higher end of your budget. If you've already looked at the cost of reserving a rental car in Costa Rica online, you've probably seen some good-looking rates. I've seen them go as low as $2 per day with some companies. The crappy thing is, your final quote probably doesn't include a proper insurance quote, which can make a considerable difference, depending on the car you get and the number of days you plan to rent.\r\n\r\nFirst, your own car insurance won't work. The Costa Rican government has strict laws on car insurance, so it will be mandatory for you to purchase at least the lowest insurance offered through your rental car company. You probably won't find out the final amount until you get there, but you should probably factor in between <a href=\"http:\/\/costa-rica-guide.com\/CarRentalInsurance.html\">$5 - $20 per day<\/a>. My quote before getting to Costa Rica was under $100 for 14 days. I was stoked. When I got my quote there, I was charged over $800. Big difference.\r\n\r\nSecond, depending on where you're going, renting the cheapest 2-wheel drive car may not be the best decision. There are certain roads you can get stuck on without 4-wheel drive, so make sure you do your research. Specifically, I had Drake Bay on my list, which added a considerable amount of driving to the itinerary once I realized the quickest route there was covered with holes and deep water during certain parts of the year. Needless to say, a 4-wheel drive will be the best move, but will cost you a lot more to rent.\r\n\r\nThird, several roads in certain parts are not well-kept, and drivers are not always at their safest. Plan on having some kind of scuff or ding on your car by the time you have to return it. Even if you stay in the city, no one will stop someone from leaning on your car or even breaking in when you aren't there to protect it. You'll want insurance, and it's probably why it costs so much in the first place.\r\n\r\n<strong>2. Certain traffic citations can cost you over $600 apiece.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nApparently, Costa Rica has the <a href=\"http:\/\/costa-rica-car-rental.autorent.cr\/trafficfines\/\">highest traffic fines in the Americas<\/a>, something the travel guide probably didn't disclose to you. Violations like speeding and running red lights are in the same bracket (the highest), and will cost you much more than they would ate home. I personally got a ticket for illegal passing by crossing the double yellow lines way out in the countryside, and got fined as if I had been drunk, armed and ran over an expensive goat.\r\n\r\nIt's probably not the best country to drive poorly in, especially with some un-kept of the roads and crazy drivers. All of that intensifies when you drive at night. You'll want to be always on the defense whenever you're on the road. That being said, several roads have extremely slow speed limits (30 km\/h in some spots in the city), and there are speed cameras to catch you when you think no one's looking (especially in San Jose). Don't speed. Don't break any traffic law. Even if everyone around you is driving horrendously, the cop will pull you over just because it happens to be your lucky day.\r\n\r\nIf you do end up getting a ticket. you'll have a chance to pay it when you turn in your rental car. They have a reporting system tied to your vehicle's ID, so your rental car company will see it and tack it onto your final bill. You can also pay it before hand at a national bank, in which case it will show up as paid when you turn in your rental. If you try to leave without paying, locals say you'll be stopped at the airport, the fine will be double and you'll have to pay it in cash before leaving the country.\r\n\r\n<strong>3. You have to pay to leave the country, anyway.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nIf you think you haven't paid enough for your overpriced Costa Rican vacation, you haven't seen the end of it 'til you're ready to bail. As of now (September 23, 2014), there is a $29 fee per person to leave Costa Rica, paid at the airport (ref. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.liberiacostaricaairport.net\/Entry_Exit_Requirements.html\">Liberia Airport<\/a>). If you're planning your honeymoon, like I was, that means you'll need to factor $54 more into your budget, just to get back home.\r\n\r\nIf you think it's annoying and greedy, <a href=\"http:\/\/travelogue.travelvice.com\/peru\/airport-departure-tax-is-a-greedy-annoyance\/\">you aren't the only one<\/a>. But quite frankly, there's nothing you can do. You'll just have to suck it up and pay.\r\n\r\nWikipedia has a <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Departure_tax\">list of countries that also charge a lame departure tax<\/a>. While Fiji takes the cake at around $110, Costa Rica surely isn't the cheapest among the greedy lot.\r\n\r\n<strong>So bring money, and lots of it!<\/strong>\r\n\r\nFolks, to be fair, it's one of the most beautiful places to visit in the Americas, and arguably one of the safest in Latin America. But best believe, you will pay every last dollar for your dream vacation in this enchanting little country, so be sure to save up and count on splurging once you get there.

title: "Changing my car's oil with a fluid extractor pump",
date: "2015-03-06 05:12:51"
---

In all my recent commotion I came across a coupon for a free oil change at Meineke and figured, why not? They're a good-sized chain, and I should be able to trust them with something as minor as an oil change, right? Wrong. Come time to do my next oil change, I can't get the drain plug out because the last guy to put it back in overtorqued it. And I mean, he overtorqued it good - that thing isn't budging, and if I got it out, it probably wouldn't go back in again. Eventually, I'll probably end up trying to fix it, whether that means putting in a bigger plug or replacing the oil pan altogether, but for now I don't have the tools or the time. <!--more Read post-->\r\n\r\nAs a result, this past weekend I bought a hand pump to get the oil out of my dipstick hole. I didn't want to splurge, so I <a title=\"Autozome Fluid Transfer Pump\" href=\"http:\/\/www.autozone.com\/test-scan-and-specialty-tools\/fluid-pump\/oem-fluid-transfer-pump\/94647_0_0\/\" target=\"_blank\">went to Autozone and got a cheap one for $14.99<\/a>. It looks like this one below.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-70\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/1-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"Fluid Transfer Pump\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nI assembled the thing and put the intake hose into my dipstick hole, and the output hose in an oil draining pan. Then started pumping. First mistake: I actually set the hose on top of the draining pan, so when the first bit of oil came from out of my engine, it spurted all over the place. I ended up lightly stepping on the end of the hose to keep it in place.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately, I ran into a problem: the bigger intake hose kept collapsing, not allowing anything to enter the pump. This kept me pumping for over half an hour trying to get the oil out of my engine. This was enough to drive anyone insane. Luckily, the pump came with another hose for pumping air that is much thicker and doesn't collapse. When I pulled off the cheap orange hose and put that stronger hose on the intake, the oil came out a lot easier, though it still took a bit more time. Needless to say, when it comes time to do my oil change again, you can bet all the money you've got that I'm not using that cheap old pump again to get the job done.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/shopping.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-71 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/shopping.jpg\" alt=\"HT Moto Oil Extractor\" width=\"266\" height=\"186\" \/><\/a>This is the alternative I'm looking at for next time, though it's over $50 before shipping costs. <a title=\"Oil extractor pump video\" href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ZPflVUzVxJ8\" target=\"_blank\">According to this guy<\/a>, the hose on this one doesn't collapse like mine did, which is an absolute must if it's going to work out. Although I probably could get it done with that other hose on my cheap pump, I'd prefer having a semi-transparent tank so I can see how much oil I've taken out much easier.\r\n\r\nMoral of the story? One, don't be lazy and do your own oil changes. Two, you definitely get what you pay for, so get the better tool if you don't want to end up doing extra work (or spending the money in the end, anyway).\r\n\r\n<strong>UPDATE<\/strong>: After changing my oil with the new pump, mentioned above, the difference is night from day. The new pump's hose is solid and does not collapse, allowing you to continuously pump without issues. It still took about 30-40 minutes to pump everything out, which is way longer than anyone wants to wait to get their oil changed. But, if you must go this route, do invest in the better pump. i will never again use the cheap pump to change my oil.

The tipping point was finding a dealer offering $4,000 off MSRP on new Camrys, and I was swayed to the better-model Toyota.\r\n\r\nLet me back track a bit. I actually started off using TrueCar to see what the lowest price points were on Corollas. I grabbed 3 certificates for guaranteed prices from TrueCar, and got to work emailing the dealers, asking them to tell me why I should buy from them. Then, hearing about the Camry special, I transitioned over from Corolla haggling to Camry haggling. My offer started off as being, I'll buy today if you give me an out-the-door price of $20,000, flat. Of course, they wouldn't do it, seeing as final closing costs could bring the price as high as $24,000 and up for a base Camry. Going back and forth, I settled with the dealer (all via email, mind you) for $21.5 out-the-door.\r\n\r\nProblem is, that dealer was over an hour away from me. There was a Toyota dealer 5 minutes away, so you bet I took his quote to them and asked if they wanted to try and beat it. Long story short, I got out of there with a 2015 Camry at $21,750 out-the-door, with tinted windows and special mats (whatever). I believe I got a great deal, but if you know better, feel free to tell me I'm wrong!\r\n\r\n<strong>A month out, how is she driving?<\/strong>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_158\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/10885122_10152646968102093_5516020701960241268_n.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-158 size-medium\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/10885122_10152646968102093_5516020701960241268_n-300x202.jpg\" alt=\"Dallas Traffic during Sleetmaggedon\" width=\"300\" height=\"202\" \/><\/a> A map of how bad traffic and accidents got when the roads iced over.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe past couple of weeks has been hectic in Dallas, in terms of weather. We've faced two days of Sleetmaggedon, and another couple of days of snow and ice on the roads. Tons of accidents, tons of drivers getting stuck on the road. This turned into an excellent opportunity to test out the Camry's capabilities in poor conditions. I was interested in particular how the traction control would fare. I didn't stress test it by any means, but I was able to get a good feel for the Camry's normal driving limits.\r\n\r\nOut of 4 days driving through ice and snow, I felt the brakes lock once for about 2-3 seconds when cars in front of me suddenly stopped on the freeway. I kept my distance and was going about 35mph, so I had time to experience the lock, regain control and still stop the car well before it was too late. Traction control kicked in and helped me out pretty quickly, but it may not have been quick enough had I been going faster or been closer to the cars ahead of me. Apart from that incident, no other locking or slipping, apart from intentionally gunning it to feel it out. The only thing I don't like is how the traction control light flashes in bright red when it kicks in, and paying attention to it would seem to give someone an anxiety attack, rather than allow them to focus on regaining control. But I don't have a better solution for how that could be.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_161\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"225\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/20150227_100540.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-161 size-medium\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/20150227_100540-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"2015 Camry LE in the Snow\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a> Camry's first snow day.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe Camry also did well accelerating uphill in icy conditions, and did not lose traction at all. Rear wheel drive cars ahead of me were having trouble regaining traction after having stopped, but the good ol' Camry had no issues making it up whatsoever. The highest incline I went up was about 40% grade, which was enough to keep an old Tacoma and a Mustang ahead of me spinning helplessly. I flipped my signal and passed right on by in the next lane.\r\n\r\n<strong>New features - well, new to me<\/strong>\r\n\r\nWhen shopping, I was ready to tell the dealers to forget selling options to me, because I wasn't interested. I thought myself a simple guy who could do more with less. However, after you purchase, it's the little things that really make for a great experience. I'll only mention two things that I enjoy on my new Camry that I didn't have in my previous car. They aren't unique to it, but not all cars come equipped with them, either.\r\n\r\nFirst are the <strong>side mirror heaters<\/strong>. No better time to appreciate these than during the DFW sleet and snowstorms. Instead of having to work to free my mirrors of icy buildup, all I had to do was hit the button, wait a few minutes, and voila - the mirrors are clear. It seems like a small thing, but man is it impressive.\r\n\r\nSecond is the <strong>touch screen<\/strong> with blue tooth capability and the back up camera. Talking on the phone while driving is legal in Texas, but it's still not a good idea with all the loonies on the road. But with your phone connected to the car's blue tooth, talking and driving is a piece of cake. And that back up camera is nothing short of amazing when you're parallel parking and need to know how far away you are from the car behind you (that's really the only time I depend on it). Gone are the days when I needed my passenger to get out and direct me when trying to fit into a tight spot downtown. The camera helps you get it right every time.\r\n\r\n<strong>Conclusion<\/strong>\r\n\r\nOverall, I'm really happy with the purchase and would definitely go for the Camry as a reliable family car, every time. I plan to have the car 20 years or more, keeping up with regular maintenance and doing whatever repairs I need to as they come. They are easy to work on and inexpensive to maintain, and that's enough to keep me a Toyota fan for a very long time.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;

Here was a recap of my experience, and a short review of driving it through extreme weather conditions in Dallas.\r\n\r\n<strong>The Buying Process<\/strong>\r\n\r\nI actually started off in the market for a new or lightly used Corolla, for the cheaper price. I figured it would do the job of being a decent family car, with few option requirements from me. I also figured I'd spend around $18,000 on a new one, or perhaps around $14,000 on a used. Then I came across this post about <a title=\"Jalopnik article on the 2014 Corolla\" href=\"http:\/\/jalopnik.com\/how-toyota-screwed-up-the-2014-toyota-corolla-1187863687\" target=\"_blank\">how Toyota screwed up the 2014 Corolla<\/a> and was a bit turned off. The tipping point was finding a dealer offering $4,000 off MSRP on new Camrys, and I was swayed to the better-model Toyota.\r\n\r\nLet me back track a bit. I actually started off using TrueCar to see what the lowest price points were on Corollas. I grabbed 3 certificates for guaranteed prices from TrueCar, and got to work emailing the dealers, asking them to tell me why I should buy from them. Then, hearing about the Camry special, I transitioned over from Corolla haggling to Camry haggling. My offer started off as being, I'll buy today if you give me an out-the-door price of $20,000, flat. Of course, they wouldn't do it, seeing as final closing costs could bring the price as high as $24,000 and up for a base Camry. Going back and forth, I settled with the dealer (all via email, mind you) for $21.5 out-the-door.\r\n\r\nProblem is, that dealer was over an hour away from me. There was a Toyota dealer 5 minutes away, so you bet I took his quote to them and asked if they wanted to try and beat it. Long story short, I got out of there with a 2015 Camry at $21,750 out-the-door, with tinted windows and special mats (whatever). I believe I got a great deal, but if you know better, feel free to tell me I'm wrong!\r\n\r\n<strong>A month out, how is she driving?<\/strong>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_158\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/10885122_10152646968102093_5516020701960241268_n.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-158 size-medium\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/10885122_10152646968102093_5516020701960241268_n-300x202.jpg\" alt=\"Dallas Traffic during Sleetmaggedon\" width=\"300\" height=\"202\" \/><\/a> A map of how bad traffic and accidents got when the roads iced over.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe past couple of weeks has been hectic in Dallas, in terms of weather. We've faced two days of Sleetmaggedon, and another couple of days of snow and ice on the roads. Tons of accidents, tons of drivers getting stuck on the road. This turned into an excellent opportunity to test out the Camry's capabilities in poor conditions. I was interested in particular how the traction control would fare. I didn't stress test it by any means, but I was able to get a good feel for the Camry's normal driving limits.\r\n\r\nOut of 4 days driving through ice and snow, I felt the brakes lock once for about 2-3 seconds when cars in front of me suddenly stopped on the freeway. I kept my distance and was going about 35mph, so I had time to experience the lock, regain control and still stop the car well before it was too late. Traction control kicked in and helped me out pretty quickly, but it may not have been quick enough had I been going faster or been closer to the cars ahead of me. Apart from that incident, no other locking or slipping, apart from intentionally gunning it to feel it out. The only thing I don't like is how the traction control light flashes in bright red when it kicks in, and paying attention to it would seem to give someone an anxiety attack, rather than allow them to focus on regaining control. But I don't have a better solution for how that could be.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_161\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"225\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/20150227_100540.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-161 size-medium\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/20150227_100540-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"2015 Camry LE in the Snow\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a> Camry's first snow day.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe Camry also did well accelerating uphill in icy conditions, and did not lose traction at all. Rear wheel drive cars ahead of me were having trouble regaining traction after having stopped, but the good ol' Camry had no issues making it up whatsoever. The highest incline I went up was about 40% grade, which was enough to keep an old Tacoma and a Mustang ahead of me spinning helplessly.

<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/20150127_170333.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-160 size-medium\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/20150127_170333-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"2015 Camry LE\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a> Just bought a 2015 Camry LE. Here was a recap of my experience, and a short review of driving it through extreme weather conditions in Dallas.\r\n\r\n<strong>The Buying Process<\/strong>\r\n\r\nI actually started off in the market for a new or lightly used Corolla, for the cheaper price. I figured it would do the job of being a decent family car, with few option requirements from me. I also figured I'd spend around $18,000 on a new one, or perhaps around $14,000 on a used. <!--more Read post-->Then I came across this post about <a title=\"Jalopnik article on the 2014 Corolla\" href=\"http:\/\/jalopnik.com\/how-toyota-screwed-up-the-2014-toyota-corolla-1187863687\" target=\"_blank\">how Toyota screwed up the 2014 Corolla<\/a> and was a bit turned off. The tipping point was finding a dealer offering $4,000 off MSRP on new Camrys, and I was swayed to the better-model Toyota.\r\n\r\nLet me back track a bit. I actually started off using TrueCar to see what the lowest price points were on Corollas. I grabbed 3 certificates for guaranteed prices from TrueCar, and got to work emailing the dealers, asking them to tell me why I should buy from them. Then, hearing about the Camry special, I transitioned over from Corolla haggling to Camry haggling. My offer started off as being, I'll buy today if you give me an out-the-door price of $20,000, flat. Of course, they wouldn't do it, seeing as final closing costs could bring the price as high as $24,000 and up for a base Camry. Going back and forth, I settled with the dealer (all via email, mind you) for $21.5 out-the-door.\r\n\r\nProblem is, that dealer was over an hour away from me. There was a Toyota dealer 5 minutes away, so you bet I took his quote to them and asked if they wanted to try and beat it. Long story short, I got out of there with a 2015 Camry at $21,750 out-the-door, with tinted windows and special mats (whatever).

One of my latest projects involves building a site using Adobe's content management system. With no technical degree and no previous training, this has really taken me a while to wrap my head around.

If you get code P0401, which is for insufficient exhaust gas recirculation detected, it's likely you have a clogged EGR valve or unit. This will also cause your car to fail emissions inspections and possibly cause your engine to run too hot. Fortunately, if it's a simple clog you're dealing with, it's an easy, do it yourself fix.\n\n&nbsp;

If you get code P0401, which is for insufficient exhaust gas recirculation detected, it's likely you have a clogged EGR valve or unit. This will also cause your car to fail emissions inspections and possibly cause your engine to run too hot. Fortunately, if it's a simple clog you're dealing with, it's an easy, do it yourself fix.

Pulled a code for a leaking intake. Inspected it, and it had completely broken off where it connects to the throttle body. So, I decided, why not put a nicer intake on it? I went to O'Reilly and bought a few parts to put it all together.

I've had my Big Baby Taylor for less than a year now, and after switching strings I noticed my action was way too high to play comfortably. I tried switching the old ones back on, but\u00a0was still bothered by the action being higher than I'm used to. I tried lowering it by sanding the saddle down, but I got it to the point where my first E slot was nearly flush with the bridge and the action was still too high. Here's a before shot of the action on my guitar:\u00a0<!--more Read post-->\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignleft wp-image-213 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/20150426_145330-e1430111756393.jpg\" alt=\"Big Baby Taylor High Action\" width=\"612\" height=\"450\" \/>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/20150426_145336.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-214 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/20150426_145336.jpg\" alt=\"Big Baby Taylor High Action, Saddle Nearly Flush\" width=\"3264\" height=\"2448\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI decided to\u00a0unscrew the neck where it is screwed onto the body, and raised it a millimeter or so using a credit card. Now the problem is solved and the difference in playability of my Big Baby Taylor is night and day.\r\n\r\nNow, I know all you \"real guitar players\" out there will frown on something like this, and I've seen people suggest only adjusting the saddle height to lower action. Happy to hear all the success stories of a simple fix like that.\u00a0But just adjusting the saddle will not do it for this guitar - at least for mine. So if you're reading this and considering doing it, jus know that it is an unconventional way of solving this problem. If you're like me and do not care, then read on.\r\n\r\nFirst, you'll need to remove the strings. After loosening the strings, I took pliers and removed the pegs\u00a0attaching them to the body.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignleft wp-image-215 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/20150426_145439.jpg\" alt=\"Big Baby Taylor Removing Strings\" width=\"3264\" height=\"2448\" \/>\r\n\r\nNext, unscrew the two screws in the neck. Don't worry about the neck falling off - it should be pretty firmly attached, even with the screws out. You'll pull the neck off in the next step.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignleft wp-image-217 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/20150426_150125-e1430112720872.jpg\" alt=\"Unscrew the neck, Big Baby Taylor\" width=\"609\" height=\"477\" \/>\r\n\r\nHere's the tricky part. You'll want to remove the neck carefully, because at this point you can really damage your guitar if you're too rough. I pushed forward on the neck, with my hand near the head of the guitar. When that moved forward a couple of inches, I began to wedge it back and forth until it came out completely. It will take a big of muscle, but eventually it will come out.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/20150426_150228.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-224 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/20150426_150228-e1430112923938.jpg\" alt=\"Pulling off the neck, Big Baby Taylor Guitar\" width=\"605\" height=\"477\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nNow that it's off, set it aside and grab an old credit card. Where the neck sits is just enough space to fit an entire credit card, or similar sized card. What you'll want to do is cut the card so that you have space for the screws to go through that area. I experimented a few ways, but eventually went with a large piece of the card beneath the screw holes, and a sliver of the card above the holes. I'd image you could just cut a square where the screw holes go.\r\n\r\nIt's important to do this step in a way that the neck will still fit on as flat as possible back onto the body. Your screws will fit on a certain way, so if the neck sits in the slot at even a slight angle, you will have problems getting it to stay put\u00a0once you put your strings back on.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/20150426_150608.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-220 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/20150426_150608-e1430113416230.jpg\" alt=\"Big Baby Taylor with a card in the neck slot\" width=\"599\" height=\"465\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nOnce you have the card cut the way you want it, wedge your neck back on, similar to the way you took it off. Be even more careful putting it back on, as you could break something during this step. The neck fits extremely snug, so make sure you've got the right angle and not too much force. Once it's flat, put the screws back in, and put a string back on to test the action. It should be adjusted to the right height with only one card, without getting vibration from the strings against the frets.\r\n\r\nIf at this point you realize that your saddle is now too low, you can adjust that by cutting a sliver from another credit card and putting it underneath the saddle. Or, of course, you could buy a new saddle.\r\n\r\nIf you did everything correctly and didn't break anything, at this point you'll be a happy camper with a much more playable Big Baby Taylor Guitar.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;

I've had my Big Baby Taylor for less than a year now, and after switching strings I noticed my action was way too high to play comfortably. I tried switching the old ones back on, but\u00a0was still bothered by the action being higher than I'm used to. I tried lowering it by sanding the saddle down, but I got it to the point where my first E slot was nearly flush with the bridge and the action was still too high. Here's a before shot of the action on my guitar:\u00a0<!--more Read post-->\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignleft wp-image-213 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/20150426_145330-e1430111756393.jpg\" alt=\"Big Baby Taylor High Action\" width=\"612\" height=\"450\" \/>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/20150426_145336.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-214 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/20150426_145336.jpg\" alt=\"Big Baby Taylor High Action, Saddle Nearly Flush\" width=\"3264\" height=\"2448\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI decided to\u00a0unscrew the neck where it is screwed onto the body, and raised it a millimeter or so using a credit card. Now the problem is solved and the difference in playability of my Big Baby Taylor is night and day.\r\n\r\nNow, I know all you \"real guitar players\" out there will frown on something like this, and I've seen people suggest only adjusting the saddle height to lower action. Happy to hear all the success stories of a simple fix like that.\u00a0But just adjusting the saddle will not do it for this guitar - at least for mine. So if you're reading this and considering doing it, jus know that it is an unconventional way of solving this problem. If you're like me and do not care, then read on.\r\n\r\nFirst, you'll need to remove the strings. After loosening the strings, I took pliers and removed the pegs\u00a0attaching them to the body.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignleft wp-image-215 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/20150426_145439.jpg\" alt=\"Big Baby Taylor Removing Strings\" width=\"3264\" height=\"2448\" \/>\r\n\r\nNext, unscrew the two screws in the neck. Don't worry about the neck falling off - it should be pretty firmly attached, even with the screws out. You'll pull the neck off in the next step.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignleft wp-image-217 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/20150426_150125-e1430112720872.jpg\" alt=\"Unscrew the neck, Big Baby Taylor\" width=\"609\" height=\"477\" \/>\r\n\r\nHere's the tricky part. You'll want to remove the neck carefully, because at this point you can really damage your guitar if you're too rough. I pushed forward on the neck, with my hand near the head of the guitar. When that moved forward a couple of inches, I began to wedge it back and forth until it came out completely. It will take a big of muscle, but eventually it will come out.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/20150426_150228.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-224 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/20150426_150228-e1430112923938.jpg\" alt=\"Pulling off the neck, Big Baby Taylor Guitar\" width=\"605\" height=\"477\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nNow that it's off, set it aside and grab an old credit card. where the neck sits is just enough space to fit an entire credit card, or similar sized card.

I overtorqued it, and when it came time to take the lug off, it was too tight and snapped right off. Tons of lessons here, but number one is this: use a torque wrench and torque your lugs, nuts and bolts down to the factory specs. You will be glad you did!\r\n\r\nIn case you haven't already Googled it, lug nuts on a 5th gen Prelude should be torqued to 80 ft-lbs. Bought a torque wrench from Harbor Freight, which cost me about $20. I hear they go on sale a lot.\r\n\r\n<strong>1. Prepare new stud<\/strong>\r\n\r\nBuy a few studs just in case you have to do this more than once. Of course, buy extra lugs as well. Also, you'll want to buy an angle grinder or something to cut metal. I picked up an angle grinder from Harbor Freight for about $18, and a pack of thin\u00a0wheels for it, about $7. \u00a0I bought the electric kind because I don't have an air compressor.\r\n\r\nWhat you need to do is cut the head of the stud almost in half, so that it fits when you're ready to\u00a0install it. Start from the inside and cut it so that it lays flat. I don't have a picture of mine, but looking at the head from the top down, it should look something like this:\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/cutstud.jpg\"><img class=\" size-full wp-image-244 alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/cutstud.jpg\" alt=\"Stud head top view after being cut\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<em><strong>Please wear gloves and safety glasses!\u00a0<\/strong><\/em>Not only can you lose a finger, but the stud will be hot when you are cutting it. Get some heavy duty gloves to be safe.\r\n\r\n<strong>2. Remove wheel<\/strong>\r\n\r\nJack the car up and take the wheel off.\r\n\r\n<strong>3. Remove the brake caliper and the bold holding the brake line<\/strong>\r\n\r\nActually, do that in reverse order. Unscrew the bolt so that you have more slack in handling the caliper once it comes off. Then, remove the two bolds securing the caliper.\u00a0I used my floor jack to hold the caliper up, but you should probably use a block of wood.\r\n\r\n<strong>4. Remove rotor<\/strong>\r\n\r\nGrab a philips screwdriver and remove the screws in front holding the brake rotor in place. This may be pretty stiff and hard to remove. I couldn't get mine off without jarring it loose with a rubber mallet. This is important for hitting that broken stud all the way through the back.\r\n\r\n<strong>5. Handle splash shield<\/strong>\r\n\r\nI say \"handle\" because you pretty much have to do what you need to do to get it out of your way. Best case scenario, you unscrew it (you'll need a short philips) and remove it. In my case, i could not remove it and ending up bending it back. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Z0avY0p0PU4\">Eric the Car Guy actually cut the one he was working on, and bended it back, in this video<\/a>. I bent mine back in place after the job, and of course, it doesn't look the same. So, \"handle\" your splash shield.\r\n\r\n<strong>6. Hammer out broken stud<\/strong>\r\n\r\nGrab your hammer and hit the broken stud out. At this point, you have a few options. The stud will not come out smoothly because there isn't enough room for you to take it out without taking apart this assembly. Some have hammered it out until it stopped, and then used their grinder to cut the bolt in half to remove it. If you have the right tool and the right amount of room, I recommend this. In my case, I hammered it all the way out, and it rubbed quite a bit before finally falling out. See the image below.\r\n\r\n<strong>7. Hammer in the new stud<\/strong>\r\n\r\nNow that the broken stud is out, you can put your new stud in place and hammer it in through the back. The last few millimeters are tough to get through, so you can either use brute force, or \u00a0screw a lug nut on and tighten. The latter is suggested by the same video I referenced above. I did not do this because I didn't want to risk breaking another stud.\r\n\r\n<strong>8. Put everything back together in reverse order<\/strong>\r\n\r\nNow that the new stud is on, put everything back together. Last but not least, <em>torque your lug nuts back on at 80 ft-lbs of torque, and no more!<\/em>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;

I overtorqued it, and when it came time to take the lug off, it was too tight and snapped right off. Tons of lessons here, but number one is this: use a torque wrench and torque your lugs, nuts and bolts down to the factory specs. You will be glad you did!\r\n\r\nIn case you haven't already Googled it, lug nuts on a 5th gen Prelude should be torqued to 80 ft-lbs. Bought a torque wrench from Harbor Freight, which cost me about $20. I hear they go on sale a lot.\r\n<h3 id=\"stepone\">1. Prepare new stud<\/h3>\r\nBuy a few studs just in case you have to do this more than once. Of course, buy extra lugs as well. Also, you'll want to buy an angle grinder or something to cut metal. I picked up an angle grinder from Harbor Freight for about $18, and a pack of thin\u00a0wheels for it, about $7. \u00a0I bought the electric kind because I don't have an air compressor.\r\n\r\nWhat you need to do is cut the head of the stud almost in half, so that it fits when you're ready to\u00a0install it. Start from the inside and cut it so that it lays flat. I don't have a picture of mine, but looking at the head from the top down, it should look something like this:\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/cutstud.jpg\"><img class=\" size-full wp-image-244 alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/cutstud.jpg\" alt=\"Stud head top view after being cut\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<em><strong>Please wear gloves and safety glasses!\u00a0<\/strong><\/em>Not only can you lose a finger, but the stud will be hot when you are cutting it.

Unscrew the bolt so that you have more slack in handling the caliper once it comes off. Then, remove the two bolds securing the caliper.\u00a0I used my floor jack to hold the caliper up, but you should probably use a block of wood.\r\n<h3 id=\"stepfour\">4. Remove rotor<\/h3>\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/20150425_160959.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-231 size-medium alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/20150425_160959-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Honda Prelude Front Caliper Off\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/20150425_163242-e1430586812793.jpg\"><img class=\" size-medium wp-image-233 alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/20150425_163242-e1430586812793-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Honda Prelude Front Brake Rotor Removed\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nGrab a philips screwdriver and remove the screws in front holding the brake rotor in place.

Best case scenario, you unscrew it (you'll need a short philips) and remove it. In my case, i could not remove it and ending up bending it back. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Z0avY0p0PU4\">Eric the Car Guy actually cut the one he was working on, and bended it back, in this video<\/a>. I bent mine back in place after the job, and of course, it doesn't look the same. So, \"handle\" your splash shield.\r\n<h3 id=\"stepsix\">6. Hammer out broken stud<\/h3>\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/20150425_163536.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-238 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/20150425_163536-e1430587108641.jpg\" alt=\"Honda Prelude Broken Stud Coming Out - Stuck\" width=\"816\" height=\"612\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nGrab your hammer and hit the broken stud out. At this point, you have a few options. The stud will not come out smoothly because there isn't enough room for you to take it out without taking apart this assembly. Some have hammered it out until it stopped, and then used their grinder to cut the bolt in half to remove it. If you have the right tool and the right amount of room, I recommend this. In my case, I hammered it all the way out, and it rubbed quite a bit before finally falling out. See the image above.\r\n<h3 id=\"stepseven\">7.

The last few millimeters are tough to get through, so you can either use brute force, or \u00a0screw a lug nut on and tighten. The latter is suggested by the same video I referenced above. I did not do this because I didn't want to risk breaking another stud.\r\n<h3 id=\"stepeight\">8. Put everything back together in reverse order<\/h3>\r\nNow that the new stud is on, put everything back together.

I overtorqued it, and when it came time to take the lug off, it was too tight and snapped right off. Tons of lessons here, but number one is this: use a torque wrench and torque your lugs, nuts and bolts down to the factory specs. You will be glad you did!\r\n\r\nIn case you haven't already Googled it, lug nuts on a 5th gen Prelude should be torqued to 80 ft-lbs. Bought a torque wrench from Harbor Freight, which cost me about $20. I hear they go on sale a lot.\r\n<h3 id=\"stepone\">1. Prepare new stud<\/h3>\r\nBuy a few studs just in case you have to do this more than once. Of course, buy extra lugs as well. Also, you'll want to buy an angle grinder or something to cut metal. I picked up an angle grinder from Harbor Freight for about $18, and a pack of thin\u00a0wheels for it, about $7. \u00a0I bought the electric kind because I don't have an air compressor.\r\n\r\nWhat you need to do is cut the head of the stud almost in half, so that it fits when you're ready to\u00a0install it. Start from the inside and cut it so that it lays flat. I don't have a picture of mine, but looking at the head from the top down, it should look something like this:\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/cutstud.jpg\"><img class=\" size-full wp-image-244 alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/cutstud.jpg\" alt=\"Stud head top view after being cut\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<em><strong>Please wear gloves and safety glasses!\u00a0<\/strong><\/em>Not only can you lose a finger, but the stud will be hot when you are cutting it. Get some heavy duty gloves to be safe.\r\n<h3 id=\"steptwo\">2. Remove wheel<\/h3>\r\nJack the car up and take the wheel off.\r\n<h3 id=\"stepthree\">3. Remove the brake caliper and the bold holding the brake line<\/h3>\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/20150425_160957.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-228\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/20150425_160957.jpg\" alt=\"Honda Prelude Front Brake Caliper Coming Off\" width=\"3264\" height=\"2448\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nActually, do that in reverse order. Unscrew the bolt so that you have more slack in handling the caliper once it comes off. Then, remove the two bolds securing the caliper.\u00a0I used my floor jack to hold the caliper up, but you should probably use a block of wood.\r\n<h3 id=\"stepfour\">4. Remove rotor<\/h3>\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/20150425_160959.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-231 size-medium alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/20150425_160959-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Honda Prelude Front Caliper Off\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/20150425_163242-e1430586812793.jpg\"><img class=\" size-medium wp-image-233 alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/20150425_163242-e1430586812793-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Honda Prelude Front Brake Rotor Removed\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nGrab a philips screwdriver and remove the screws in front holding the brake rotor in place. This may be pretty stiff and hard to remove. I couldn't get mine off without jarring it loose with a rubber mallet. This is important for hitting that broken stud all the way through the back.\r\n<h3 id=\"stepfive\">5. Handle splash shield<\/h3>\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/20150425_163402.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-234 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/20150425_163402-e1430587046866.jpg\" alt=\"Honda Prelude Broken Stud Coming Out\" width=\"816\" height=\"612\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nI say \"handle\" because you pretty much have to do what you need to do to get it out of your way. Best case scenario, you unscrew it (you'll need a short philips) and remove it. In my case, i could not remove it and ending up bending it back. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Z0avY0p0PU4\">Eric the Car Guy actually cut the one he was working on, and bended it back, in this video<\/a>. I bent mine back in place after the job, and of course, it doesn't look the same. So, \"handle\" your splash shield.\r\n<h3 id=\"stepsix\">6. Hammer out broken stud<\/h3>\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/20150425_163536.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-238 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/20150425_163536-e1430587108641.jpg\" alt=\"Honda Prelude Broken Stud Coming Out - Stuck\" width=\"816\" height=\"612\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nGrab your hammer and hit the broken stud out. At this point, you have a few options. The stud will not come out smoothly because there isn't enough room for you to take it out without taking apart this assembly. Some have hammered it out until it stopped, and then used their grinder to cut the bolt in half to remove it. If you have the right tool and the right amount of room, I recommend this. In my case, I hammered it all the way out, and it rubbed quite a bit before finally falling out. See the image above.\r\n<h3 id=\"stepseven\">7. Hammer in the new stud<\/h3>\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/20150425_164235.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-241 size-medium\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/20150425_164235-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"New Stud Going Into Honda Prelude Front Wheel\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/20150425_164406.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-242\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/20150425_164406-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"New Stud Inside Honda Prelude Front Wheel - Top View\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nNow that the broken stud is out, you can put your new stud in place and hammer it in through the back. The last few millimeters are tough to get through, so you can either use brute force, or \u00a0screw a lug nut on and tighten. The latter is suggested by the same video I referenced above. I did not do this because I didn't want to risk breaking another stud.\r\n<h3 id=\"stepeight\">8. Put everything back together in reverse order<\/h3>\r\nNow that the new stud is on, put everything back together. Last but not least, <em>torque your lug nuts back on at 80 ft-lbs of torque, and no more!<\/em>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;

This is not the easiest repair, but it is do-able at home. To make things easier, I'd suggest getting someone to help at a certain point - preferably someone with small hands and forearms.

Jack the front of the car up, and remove the front left wheel for better accessibility.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nYou don't need the whole car up, but it wouldn't hurt. Use jack stands. You'll appreciate having the wheel out of the way when you have to get under the car.\r\n\r\n<strong>2. Remove the two 10mm bolts attaching the PS (power steering) hose to the pump.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThen, slowly, pull the hose straight up and off of its connection. Do it slowly because fluid is going to drain out of the hose when you pull it up. Let it drain back down into the reservoir.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_263\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"612\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/2015-05-16-2.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-263 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/2015-05-16-2-e1431815014122.jpg\" alt=\"Honda Prelude Removing the Power Steering Hose - Top View\" width=\"612\" height=\"503\" \/><\/a> Do this slowly, as fluid will drain out of the hose when you remove it here.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>3. Remove\u00a0the sensor connector, and the bolts holding the mid-section of the hose in place.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe sensor is located underneath the engine, and attaches to the hose. <strong>WEAR SAFETY GOGGLES.<\/strong> The first bolt is in plain sight on the cover of the engine block. The second one I would actually not even attempt unless you have the engine lifted. Otherwise, I don't understand how anyone could reach it. It is accessed by getting underneath the engine and feeling around the path of the hose. The bolt is facing upward. I ended up cutting the material actually holding the hose and pulling it out of there, and didn't touch that pesky bolt. If you can get to\u00a0the bolt somehow, well, good for you.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_264\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"625\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/2015-05-16-3.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-264 size-large\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/2015-05-16-3-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Honda Prelude Power Steering Hose Sensor - Bottom View\" width=\"625\" height=\"469\" \/><\/a> This is the view of the sensor from below, underneath the engine.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>4. Put a drain pan underneath the hose where it attaches to the rack and pinion, and unscrew the bolt on the end of the old hose.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThis part is lame because it's pretty far down in the engine bay and extremely hard to reach. This is where your friend with slender limbs might come in handy, but if you can get to it, you'll need an open ended wrench. I believe it takes a 13mm. I was able to get to it from the top, without getting underneath the car. You can reach it from underneath the car, but you won't have much room to fit the wrench unless you take out more parts. Once you unscrew it enough to finish it by hand, you'll notice fluid starting to leak out. Pull it all the way out.\r\n\r\n<strong>5. Remove the old hose, transfer the sensor, and and set the new hose in place.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nAt this point, you should be able to remove the old hose. I pulled it down from the bottom. Remove the sensor from the old hose (I used an adjustable wrench), and install it onto the new hose. I bought an aftermarket hose from <a title=\"Car Part Kings\" href=\"http:\/\/carpartkings.com\" target=\"_blank\">carpartkings.com<\/a>, which took forever to ship but was only about $60. Your new hose should also come with O-rings, which you should install on both ends. Otherwise, your new hose could leak at the connections. \u00a0I put the hose in from the top. It can be difficult to wiggle the metal end of the hose around the fixtures, but be patient and gentle - you'll eventually get it in place.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_267\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"607\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/2015-05-16-6.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-267 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/2015-05-16-6-e1431815242828.jpg\" alt=\"5th Gen Honda Prelude Old Power Steering Hose Removed\" width=\"607\" height=\"377\" \/><\/a> Old power steering hose removed.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_268\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"603\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/2015-05-16-7.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-268 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/2015-05-16-7-e1431815280200.jpg\" alt=\"Honda Prelude Power Steering Hose Sensor\" width=\"603\" height=\"405\" \/><\/a> The sensor screws off here.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_266\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"625\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/2015-05-16-5.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-266 size-large\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/2015-05-16-5-e1431815318691-1024x647.jpg\" alt=\"Honda Prelude Power Steering Hose O-Ring - 1\" width=\"625\" height=\"395\" \/><\/a> Lube the o-rings with PS fluid.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/2015-05-16-4.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-265\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/2015-05-16-4-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Honda Prelude Power Steering Hose O-Ring - 2\" width=\"625\" height=\"469\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<strong>6. Screw in the bolt on the hose to attach it to the rack and pinion assembly.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThis part can be extremely difficult, and for me it was impossible without someone else's help. The hose and bolt need to go in completely straight, and you need to start the threads by hand. To get it straight, I went underneath the car and held the metal part of the hose, at the part where it curves, and pulled it downward. That allowed me to line it up just right, and my wife screwed in the bolt by hand from the top. I attempted to do this by myself for several hours with no success. With someone else's help, we got it straight in within 10 minutes.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_269\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"625\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/2015-05-16-8.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-269\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/2015-05-16-8-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Power Steering Hose, Honda Prelude - View from Top\" width=\"625\" height=\"469\" \/><\/a> Way down at the bottom you can see the new hose connection almost in place. It's silver\/blue.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>7. Screw in the bolts holding the mid-section of the hose in place.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nOverlooking the hard-to-get bolt I mentioned above, this should be fairly straight forward. At this point you are putting things back together, following these steps in reverse order.\r\n\r\n<strong>8. Screw in the two 10mm bolts attaching the hose to the pump.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nAlso straight forward. Except in my case, the aftermarket hose I bought ended up being too thick at the part where it attaches to the pump, so I ended up having to buy longer bolts to fasten it on. If this is your case, the size you'll need is M6 x 1.0, I believe. Get them a little longer, and in my case I used an electric angle grinder (about $20 at <a title=\"Harbor Freight\" href=\"http:\/\/www.harborfreight.com\" target=\"_blank\">Harbor Freight<\/a>) to shave off the length I did not need.\r\n\r\n<strong>9. Replace Honda\u00a0power steering fluid to the top line.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nMake sure it's Honda-approved fluid; otherwise, you'll break the pump. I bought a\u00a032oz bottle and used maybe half of it, total. Fill the reservoir to the line.\r\n\r\nNow, in my case, I had put some Lucas Stop Leak in, and after talking to different people, I decided to pump all of that old stuff back out (I saved the old fluid and put it back in). I used a <a title=\"Changing my car\u2019s oil with a fluid extractor pump\" href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/changing-cars-oil-fluid-extractor-pump\/\">fluid transfer pump<\/a>, and, with the car off, turned the steering wheel back and forth to get the fluid back into the reservoir until nothing else came out. Everyone from the folks at O'Reilly and Autozone to my buddy who is getting his Honda certification said that anything other than the Honda PS fluid, including Lucas, will ruin my pump. That's in spite of Lucas claiming it works in all cars.\r\n\r\n<strong>10. With the car still jacked up and car off, turn the steering wheel back and forth several times.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThis will circulate the fluid through your system, and hopefully prevent air from getting in. Make sure you do this with both front wheels up in the air. The fluid level should go down after you turn the wheel (all the way) to the left and to the right several times.\r\n\r\n<strong>11. Refill the PS fluid to the top line.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nFill it back up to the line, and you're good to go!

It can be difficult to wiggle the metal end of the hose around the fixtures, but be patient and gentle - you'll eventually get it in place.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_267\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"607\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/2015-05-16-6.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-267 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/2015-05-16-6-e1431815242828.jpg\" alt=\"5th Gen Honda Prelude Old Power Steering Hose Removed\" width=\"607\" height=\"377\" \/><\/a> Old power steering hose removed.[\/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_268\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"603\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/2015-05-16-7.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-268 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/2015-05-16-7-e1431815280200.jpg\" alt=\"Honda Prelude Power Steering Hose Sensor\" width=\"603\" height=\"405\" \/><\/a> The sensor screws off here.[\/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_266\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"625\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/2015-05-16-5.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-266 size-large\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/2015-05-16-5-e1431815318691-1024x647.jpg\" alt=\"Honda Prelude Power Steering Hose O-Ring - 1\" width=\"625\" height=\"395\" \/><\/a> Lube the o-rings with PS fluid.[\/caption]\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/2015-05-16-4.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-265\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/2015-05-16-4-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Honda Prelude Power Steering Hose O-Ring - 2\" width=\"625\" height=\"469\" \/><\/a>\n\n<strong>6.

Put a drain pan underneath the hose where it attaches to the rack and pinion, and unscrew the bolt on the end of the old hose.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThis part is lame because it's pretty far down in the engine bay and extremely hard to reach. This is where your friend with slender limbs might come in handy, but if you can get to it, you'll need an open ended wrench. I was able to get to it from the top, without getting underneath the car. You can reach it from underneath the car, but you won't have much room to fit the wrench unless you tai rout more parts. Once you unscrew it enough to finish it by hand, you'll notice fluid starting to leak out. Pull it all the way out.\r\n\r\n<strong>5. Remove the old hose, transfer the sensor, and and set the new hose in place.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nAt this point, you should be able to remove the old hose. I pulled it down from the bottom. Remove the sensor from the old hose (I used an adjustable wrench), and install it onto the new hose. Your new hose should also come with O-rings, which you should install on both ends. Otherwise, your new hose could leak at the connections. \u00a0I put the hose in from the top. It can be difficult to wiggle the metal end of the hose around the fixtures, but be patient and gentle - you'll eventually get it in place.\r\n\r\n<strong>6. Screw in the bolt on the hose to attach it to the rack and pinion.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThis part can be extremely difficult, and for me it was impossible without someone else's help. The hose and bolt need to go in completely straight, and you need to start the threads by hand. To get it straight, I went underneath the car and held the metal part of the hose, at the part where it curves, and pulled it downward. That allowed me to line it up just right, and my wife screwed in the bolt by hand from the top. I attempted to do this by myself for several hours with no success. With someone else's help, we got it straight in within 10 minutes.\r\n\r\n<strong>7. Screw in the bolts holding the mid-section of the hose in place.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nOverlooking the hard-to-get bolt I mentioned above, this should be fairly straight forward. At this point you are putting things back together, following these steps in reverse order.\r\n\r\n<strong>8. Screw in the two 10mm bolts attaching the hose to the pump.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nAlso straight forward. Except in my case, the aftermarket hose I bought ended up being too thick at the part where it attaches to the pump, so I ended up having to buy longer bolts to fasten it on. If this is your case, the size you'll need is M6 x 1.0, I believe. Get them a little longer, and in my case I used an electric angle grinder (about $20 at Harbor Freight) to shave off the length I did not need.\r\n\r\n<strong>9. Replace HONDA power steering fluid to the top line.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nMake sure it's Honda-approved fluid; otherwise, you'll break the pump. I bought the bigger-size, while I believe is about 32oz, and used maybe half of it, total. Fill the reservoir to the line.\r\n\r\nNow, in my case, I had put some Lucas Stop Leak in, and after talking to different people, I decided to pump all of that old stuff back out (I saved the old fluid and put it back in). I used a fluid transfer pump, and, with the car off, turned the steering wheel back and forth to get the fluid back into the reservoir until nothing else came out. Everyone from the folks at O'Reilly and Autozone to my buddy who is getting his Honda certification said that anything other than the Honda PS fluid, including Lucas, will ruin my pump. That's in spite of Lucas claiming it works in all cars.\r\n\r\n<strong>10. With the car still jacked up and car off, turn the steering wheel back and forth several times.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThis will circulate the fluid through your system, and hopefully prevent air from getting in. Make sure you do this with both front wheels up in the air. The fluid level should go down after you turn the wheel (all the way) to the left and to the right several times.\r\n\r\n<strong>11. Refill the PS fluid to the top line.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nFill it back up to the line, and you're good to go!

Make sure you do this with both front wheels up in the air. The fluid level should go down after you turn the wheel (all the way) to the left and to the right several times.\r\n\r\n<strong>11. Refill the PS fluid to the top line.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nFill it back up to the line, and you're good to go!

Jack the front of the car up, and remove the front left wheel for better accessibility.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nYou don't need the whole car up, but it wouldn't hurt. Use jack stands. You'll appreciate having the wheel out of the way when you have to get under the car.\r\n\r\n<strong>2. Remove the two 10mm bolts attaching the PS (power steering) hose to the pump.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThen, slowly, pull the hose straight up and off of its connection. Do it slowly because fluid is going to drain out of the hose when you pull it up. Let it drain back down into the reservoir.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_263\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"612\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/2015-05-16-2.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-263 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/2015-05-16-2-e1431815014122.jpg\" alt=\"Honda Prelude Removing the Power Steering Hose - Top View\" width=\"612\" height=\"503\" \/><\/a> Do this slowly, as fluid will drain out of the hose when you remove it here.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>3. Remove\u00a0the sensor connector, and the bolts holding the mid-section of the hose in place.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe sensor is located underneath the engine, and attaches to the hose. <strong>WEAR SAFETY GOGGLES.<\/strong> The first bolt is in plain sight on the cover of the engine block. The second one I would actually not even attempt unless you have the engine lifted. Otherwise, I don't understand how anyone could reach it. It is accessed by getting underneath the engine and feeling around the path of the hose. The bolt is facing upward. I ended up cutting the material actually holding the hose and pulling it out of there, and didn't touch that pesky bolt. If you can get to\u00a0the bolt somehow, well, good for you.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_264\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"625\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/2015-05-16-3.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-264 size-large\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/2015-05-16-3-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Honda Prelude Power Steering Hose Sensor - Bottom View\" width=\"625\" height=\"469\" \/><\/a> This is the view of the sensor from below, underneath the engine.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>4. Put a drain pan underneath the hose where it attaches to the rack and pinion, and unscrew the bolt on the end of the old hose.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThis part is lame because it's pretty far down in the engine bay and extremely hard to reach. This is where your friend with slender limbs might come in handy, but if you can get to it, you'll need an open ended wrench. I believe it takes a 13mm. I was able to get to it from the top, without getting underneath the car. You can reach it from underneath the car, but you won't have much room to fit the wrench unless you tai rout more parts. Once you unscrew it enough to finish it by hand, you'll notice fluid starting to leak out. Pull it all the way out.\r\n\r\n<strong>5. Remove the old hose, transfer the sensor, and and set the new hose in place.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nAt this point, you should be able to remove the old hose. I pulled it down from the bottom. Remove the sensor from the old hose (I used an adjustable wrench), and install it onto the new hose. I bought an aftermarket hose from <a title=\"Car Part Kings\" href=\"http:\/\/carpartkings.com\" target=\"_blank\">carpartkings.com<\/a>, which took forever to ship but was only about $60. Your new hose should also come with O-rings, which you should install on both ends. Otherwise, your new hose could leak at the connections. \u00a0I put the hose in from the top. It can be difficult to wiggle the metal end of the hose around the fixtures, but be patient and gentle - you'll eventually get it in place.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_267\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"607\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/2015-05-16-6.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-267 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/2015-05-16-6-e1431815242828.jpg\" alt=\"5th Gen Honda Prelude Old Power Steering Hose Removed\" width=\"607\" height=\"377\" \/><\/a> Old power steering hose removed.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_268\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"603\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/2015-05-16-7.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-268 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/2015-05-16-7-e1431815280200.jpg\" alt=\"Honda Prelude Power Steering Hose Sensor\" width=\"603\" height=\"405\" \/><\/a> The sensor screws off here.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_266\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"625\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/2015-05-16-5.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-266 size-large\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/2015-05-16-5-e1431815318691-1024x647.jpg\" alt=\"Honda Prelude Power Steering Hose O-Ring - 1\" width=\"625\" height=\"395\" \/><\/a> Lube the o-rings with PS fluid.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/2015-05-16-4.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-265\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/2015-05-16-4-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Honda Prelude Power Steering Hose O-Ring - 2\" width=\"625\" height=\"469\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<strong>6. Screw in the bolt on the hose to attach it to the rack and pinion assembly.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThis part can be extremely difficult, and for me it was impossible without someone else's help. The hose and bolt need to go in completely straight, and you need to start the threads by hand. To get it straight, I went underneath the car and held the metal part of the hose, at the part where it curves, and pulled it downward. That allowed me to line it up just right, and my wife screwed in the bolt by hand from the top. I attempted to do this by myself for several hours with no success. With someone else's help, we got it straight in within 10 minutes.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_269\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"625\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/2015-05-16-8.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-269\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/2015-05-16-8-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Power Steering Hose, Honda Prelude - View from Top\" width=\"625\" height=\"469\" \/><\/a> Way down at the bottom you can see the new hose connection almost in place. It's silver\/blue.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>7. Screw in the bolts holding the mid-section of the hose in place.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nOverlooking the hard-to-get bolt I mentioned above, this should be fairly straight forward. At this point you are putting things back together, following these steps in reverse order.\r\n\r\n<strong>8. Screw in the two 10mm bolts attaching the hose to the pump.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nAlso straight forward. Except in my case, the aftermarket hose I bought ended up being too thick at the part where it attaches to the pump, so I ended up having to buy longer bolts to fasten it on. If this is your case, the size you'll need is M6 x 1.0, I believe. Get them a little longer, and in my case I used an electric angle grinder (about $20 at <a title=\"Harbor Freight\" href=\"http:\/\/www.harborfreight.com\" target=\"_blank\">Harbor Freight<\/a>) to shave off the length I did not need.\r\n\r\n<strong>9. Replace Honda\u00a0power steering fluid to the top line.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nMake sure it's Honda-approved fluid; otherwise, you'll break the pump. I bought a\u00a032oz bottle and used maybe half of it, total. Fill the reservoir to the line.\r\n\r\nNow, in my case, I had put some Lucas Stop Leak in, and after talking to different people, I decided to pump all of that old stuff back out (I saved the old fluid and put it back in). I used a <a title=\"Changing my car\u2019s oil with a fluid extractor pump\" href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/changing-cars-oil-fluid-extractor-pump\/\">fluid transfer pump<\/a>, and, with the car off, turned the steering wheel back and forth to get the fluid back into the reservoir until nothing else came out. Everyone from the folks at O'Reilly and Autozone to my buddy who is getting his Honda certification said that anything other than the Honda PS fluid, including Lucas, will ruin my pump. That's in spite of Lucas claiming it works in all cars.\r\n\r\n<strong>10. With the car still jacked up and car off, turn the steering wheel back and forth several times.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThis will circulate the fluid through your system, and hopefully prevent air from getting in. Make sure you do this with both front wheels up in the air. The fluid level should go down after you turn the wheel (all the way) to the left and to the right several times.\r\n\r\n<strong>11. Refill the PS fluid to the top line.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nFill it back up to the line, and you're good to go!

It started fine when it was cold, but after driving it for 15 minutes or more and shutting it off, it would crank, but would have trouble turning over and running.

This is not the easiest repair, but it is do-able at home. To make things easier, I'd suggest getting someone to help at a certain point - preferably someone with small hands and forearms.

Jack the front of the car up, and remove the front left wheel for better accessibility.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nYou don't need the whole car up, but it wouldn't hurt. Use jack stands. You'll appreciate having the wheel out of the way when you have to get under the car.\r\n\r\n<strong>2. Remove the two 10mm bolts attaching the PS (power steering) hose to the pump.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThen, slowly, pull the hose straight up and off of its connection. Do it slowly because fluid is going to drain out of the hose when you pull it up. Let it drain back down into the reservoir.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_263\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"612\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/2015-05-16-2.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-263 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/2015-05-16-2-e1431815014122.jpg\" alt=\"Honda Prelude Removing the Power Steering Hose - Top View\" width=\"612\" height=\"503\" \/><\/a> Do this slowly, as fluid will drain out of the hose when you remove it here.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>3. Remove\u00a0the sensor connector, and the bolts holding the mid-section of the hose in place.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe sensor is located underneath the engine, and attaches to the hose. <strong>WEAR SAFETY GOGGLES.<\/strong> The first bolt is in plain sight on the cover of the engine block. The second one I would actually not even attempt unless you have the engine lifted. Otherwise, I don't understand how anyone could reach it. It is accessed by getting underneath the engine and feeling around the path of the hose. The bolt is facing upward. I ended up cutting the material actually holding the hose and pulling it out of there, and didn't touch that pesky bolt. If you can get to\u00a0the bolt somehow, well, good for you.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_264\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"625\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/2015-05-16-3.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-264 size-large\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/2015-05-16-3-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Honda Prelude Power Steering Hose Sensor - Bottom View\" width=\"625\" height=\"469\" \/><\/a> This is the view of the sensor from below, underneath the engine.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>4. Put a drain pan underneath the hose where it attaches to the rack and pinion, and unscrew the bolt on the end of the old hose.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThis part is lame because it's pretty far down in the engine bay and extremely hard to reach. This is where your friend with slender limbs might come in handy, but if you can get to it, you'll need an open ended wrench. I believe it takes a 13mm. I was able to get to it from the top, without getting underneath the car. You can reach it from underneath the car, but you won't have much room to fit the wrench unless you take out more parts. Once you unscrew it enough to finish it by hand, you'll notice fluid starting to leak out. Pull it all the way out.\r\n\r\n<strong>5. Remove the old hose, transfer the sensor, and and set the new hose in place.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nAt this point, you should be able to remove the old hose. I pulled it down from the bottom. Remove the sensor from the old hose (I used an adjustable wrench), and install it onto the new hose. I bought an aftermarket hose from <a title=\"Car Part Kings\" href=\"http:\/\/carpartkings.com\" target=\"_blank\">carpartkings.com<\/a>, which took forever to ship but was only about $60. Your new hose should also come with O-rings, which you should install on both ends. Otherwise, your new hose could leak at the connections. \u00a0I put the hose in from the top. It can be difficult to wiggle the metal end of the hose around the fixtures, but be patient and gentle - you'll eventually get it in place.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_267\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"607\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/2015-05-16-6.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-267 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/2015-05-16-6-e1431815242828.jpg\" alt=\"5th Gen Honda Prelude Old Power Steering Hose Removed\" width=\"607\" height=\"377\" \/><\/a> Old power steering hose removed.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_268\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"603\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/2015-05-16-7.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-268 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/2015-05-16-7-e1431815280200.jpg\" alt=\"Honda Prelude Power Steering Hose Sensor\" width=\"603\" height=\"405\" \/><\/a> The sensor screws off here.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_266\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"625\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/2015-05-16-5.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-266 size-large\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/2015-05-16-5-e1431815318691-1024x647.jpg\" alt=\"Honda Prelude Power Steering Hose O-Ring - 1\" width=\"625\" height=\"395\" \/><\/a> Lube the o-rings with PS fluid.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/2015-05-16-4.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-265\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/2015-05-16-4-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Honda Prelude Power Steering Hose O-Ring - 2\" width=\"625\" height=\"469\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<strong>6. Screw in the bolt on the hose to attach it to the rack and pinion assembly.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThis part can be extremely difficult, and for me it was impossible without someone else's help. The hose and bolt need to go in completely straight, and you need to start the threads by hand. To get it straight, I went underneath the car and held the metal part of the hose, at the part where it curves, and pulled it downward. That allowed me to line it up just right, and my wife screwed in the bolt by hand from the top. I attempted to do this by myself for several hours with no success. With someone else's help, we got it straight in within 10 minutes.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_269\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"625\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/2015-05-16-8.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-269\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/2015-05-16-8-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Power Steering Hose, Honda Prelude - View from Top\" width=\"625\" height=\"469\" \/><\/a> Way down at the bottom you can see the new hose connection almost in place. It's silver\/blue.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>7. Screw in the bolts holding the mid-section of the hose in place.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nOverlooking the hard-to-get bolt I mentioned above, this should be fairly straight forward. At this point you are putting things back together, following these steps in reverse order.\r\n\r\n<strong>8. Screw in the two 10mm bolts attaching the hose to the pump.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nAlso straight forward. Except in my case, the aftermarket hose I bought ended up being too thick at the part where it attaches to the pump, so I ended up having to buy longer bolts to fasten it on. If this is your case, the size you'll need is M6 x 1.0, I believe. Get them a little longer, and in my case I used an electric angle grinder (about $20 at <a title=\"Harbor Freight\" href=\"http:\/\/www.harborfreight.com\" target=\"_blank\">Harbor Freight<\/a>) to shave off the length I did not need.\r\n\r\n<strong>9. Replace Honda\u00a0power steering fluid to the top line.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nMake sure it's Honda-approved fluid; otherwise, you'll break the pump. I bought a\u00a032oz bottle and used maybe half of it, total. Fill the reservoir to the line.\r\n\r\nNow, in my case, I had put some Lucas Stop Leak in, and after talking to different people, I decided to pump all of that old stuff back out (I saved the old fluid and put it back in). I used a <a title=\"Changing my car\u2019s oil with a fluid extractor pump\" href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/changing-cars-oil-fluid-extractor-pump\/\">fluid transfer pump<\/a>, and, with the car off, turned the steering wheel back and forth to get the fluid back into the reservoir until nothing else came out. Everyone from the folks at O'Reilly and Autozone to my buddy who is getting his Honda certification said that anything other than the Honda PS fluid, including Lucas, will ruin my pump. That's in spite of Lucas claiming it works in all cars.\r\n\r\n<strong>10. With the car still jacked up and car off, turn the steering wheel back and forth several times.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThis will circulate the fluid through your system, and hopefully prevent air from getting in. Make sure you do this with both front wheels up in the air. The fluid level should go down after you turn the wheel (all the way) to the left and to the right several times.\r\n\r\n<strong>11. Refill the PS fluid to the top line.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nFill it back up to the line, and you're good to go!

My 1990 F150 was having trouble starting after it had already warmed up. It started fine when it was cold, but after driving it for 15 minutes or more and shutting it off, it would crank, but would have trouble turning over and running. I would have to wait 10 to 15 minutes to let it cool down, and then it would have enough juice to start.\r\n\r\nMy battery is still only 6 months old, so I knew there probably wasn't a problem with it.

<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I recently had a conversation with two high school friends about conspiracy theories and the last days. Apparently there is a ton of new developments regarding apocalyptic events in the past few years that I was completely unaware of prior to our conversation. You can get lost keeping track of everything going on; there are so many details that could potentially apply or point to the beginnings of this or that prophecy. Hats off to those diligent enough to keep tabs. I'm not one to recognize things of this sort until they are nearly right in front of my face.<!--more Read post--><\/p>\r\nIn a sense I feel it is not completely necessary for me to keep such close tabs, for a number of reasons. For one, a certain other friend of ours made a comment that once certain things are upon us, there is little we can do to prepare for them in the outward sense of sourcing food and water or amassing weapons. I do agree with that for the most part. Second, in considering the four riders of the horses in Revelation, there have always been the three negative ones running (death, famine and sickness), and they will continue to run until the end of the current age, but as a Christian my role is to consider the white horse (gospel) and opportunities for it to gain ground in the race.\r\n\r\nThat said, I do feel this type of discussion does a great job of waking me up and sobering my mind. It's all too easy to get distracted by daily necessities and the cares in the world, and to remain in that state for periods of time, and to forget about what is truly important. I do believe a Christian should live in a normal way, with longevity in mind, taking care of human responsibilities. But he also needs to be aware that things can change--major things--within a very short period of time, and live soberly, as if on any given day he would be taken to meet his master. That I feel I've personally neglected for quite some time and am slowly coming to grips with the reality I've always held to be true in my core. But you know what they say: admission is the first step.\r\n\r\nWith recent events occurring in the world scenario, the overwhelming theme we can see is an increased propensity for chaos and instability, with social media and the internet as a multiplier, along with subtle desensitization of our generation. I can't say that anything has happened to directly fulfill any word (if it has I don't know of it), but it's easy to see that the stage is being set for an interesting turn of events.

Last week I attended Digital Summit, and the first keynote speaker was Seth Godin. Of the many quotes I was able to capture and tweet from his speech and Q&amp;A session, one was the title of this post. We should blog every day to get our head straight--something like that. So, here I am, taking his advice.<!--more Read post-->\r\n\r\nI was actually inspired to write regularly a couple weeks prior by Jordan Peterson, the professor at University of Toronto who has been in the news much lately. He believes that writing down thoughts and working out our issues through writing is not only effective, but also rewires our brain in positive ways. He hawked his Future Writing Program on his spot on Joe Rogan's podcast, and I got it online from his website free. For the past 15 years or so I haven't been the type to think heavily about my future, further than perhaps morw than 5 years at a time. I haven't started on the exercise yet so I'm not sure what to expect, but I do hope it turns out to be as rewarding as he said it would be.\r\n\r\nAll this has come, like most things in life seem to, at a timely moment where I feel more upside down than most others. I just bought a house and after two weeks am still a good 30% away from a decent completion point of my move; my wife and kids just got over being sick; my workout routine has lost its rhythm; my bedtime and waking time have gotten later and more taxing on my day. The latter two I consider the most concerning of them all; it seems once I lose my sleep and exercise patterns, the rest of the habits that keep me afloat start coming down one by one. It would seem to me a great time to stop and reconsider my life by means of writing, as suggested by these great thinkers and influencers.\r\n\r\nSaving other topics for other days, I'll dig into working out. It's the habit I've always strived to maintain, but have without fail always done in sprints of a few months and slowly given up. I'd say the first of these sprints began around 10th grade when, as a new kid at a new high school, I experienced a few instances of bullying by a certain upper classmen. Though it was more of a brief intimidation each time, the guy was significantly bigger than I was and was almost always heckling together with his jock friends. I've always been the smaller guy, and at the time I hadn't been in more than a couple of fights in my life, so I was easy to intimidate for this guy. After the second incident, I went home and started curling my guitar in its hard case, determined to do something about my size and defend myself against the likes of that guy. I guess that was my first self-motivated workout experience.\r\n\r\nFast forward to my post college years, circa mid 2011, I had gained a lot more experience of mostly body weight workouts, and I joined a dance team. After one of our practices for whatever reason I propose arm wrestling and gut punching with the other guys. Only one (Juan) was able to beat me at arm wrestling, and no one punched out my gut to stoppage. I realized I was naturally stronger than many of those guys and I liked the feeling--just about the first time in my life I had the upper hand in strength among my peers. I score a dumbell swt from my room mate, and I still work out with that set to this very day.\r\n\r\nIt would seem to me that working out has much more to do with my psyche than I realize at any given time. I work out consistently when I'm feeling good, and when I'm in that rhythm, I feel even better from day to day. What I struggle with the most is ignoring my mood and working out in spite of it, which has to happen since I'm not guaranteed a good mood everyday. There are only benefits to doing so, including improving my mood at that instant, and more importantly, keeping the rhythm of the work out habit to maintain the order of things in my life.\r\n\r\nI have more daily habits with similar issues I want to draw comparisons to, but in the interest of time and sustainable blogging I will save them for another time. Takeaway #1 to blog everyday, and #2 is to work out everyday, regardless of my mood.

title: "My Challenges as a New Homeowner",
date: "2016-12-13 23:30:12"

The reality that home ownership is a nightmare and a money suck is week by week etching itself into my mind. I am a not yet a month in and have already dealt with a handful of costly challenges that I never expected going into the deal. It appears everyone has their own seemingly unique set of issues to sort out, so there is no definitive list you could use to ensure all your \"T\"s are crossed and \"I\"s dotted. <!--more Read post-->\r\n\r\n<strong>1. Rats in the attic<\/strong>\r\n\r\nA week into moving out of our old place, my wife and I sat down at our dining table after a day of packing moving and cleaning around 10PM. All of a sudden we heard a scratching noise running up the wall and across the ceiling. We looked at each other, jaws dropped; we knew we had some sort of pest to deal with. I ran upstairs with a flashlight and open the hatch. Lo and behold, a rat was staring at me from the other side of the attic.\r\n\r\nAmong the different types of pest control methods attempted, what has worked so far are the standard wood and metal bar snap traps. I've killed two rats in them, and I'm certain a third is still hiding, avoiding the fate of its comrades. I may need to switch up the peanut butter and use something more enticing to catch this straggler.\r\n\r\n<strong>2. Plumbing\/Sewer Issues<\/strong>\r\n\r\nAbout a week after moving in, I began to smell some odd odor coming from the guest bathroom. Fast forward to this week, the smell is unbearable if the door is shut and the ventilation turned off. Something in there has gotten progressively worse.\r\n\r\nWe made a claim with our home warrant company, and they sent a plumber over to diagnose the issue yesterday. He noticed the wax seal under our toilet was nearly gone, so he replaced that. After waiting several hours and rechecking, the smell persisted. So that was $60 down the drain, and no skin off the home warranty company's back.\r\n\r\nAs of yesterday I finally found that most of the odor is coming from the bathtub drain, so I'm currently attempting to neutralize it with bleach. Really hoping to not have to do any major repairs.\r\n\r\n<strong>3. Created an account for water and electricity, but not gas<\/strong>\r\n\r\nOur furnace and water heater are run by gas, not electricity. I found that out two days ago when my wife texted me saying the heater wasn't working, and she couldn't get hot water. Called Atmos, and the soonest the can come out is tomorrow. So we are now on day two of no showers (it's 38 degrees F in Dallas at the moment), and the fireplace and space heaters are in full effect.\r\n\r\n<strong>4. Got\u00a0the wrong size refrigerator<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThis one was also completely my fault. The space between my counter and pantry will only take a 35\" wide refrigerator, and the one I got is 36\". Measuring should have been a no-brainer. Wise advice from a coworker: If you think it may kinda fit and you can just muscle it in, more than likely, it's not going to fit.\r\n\r\n<strong>5. Mold in my air ducts<\/strong>\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how this one got past inspection, but to their credit, you did have to remove the vent covers and shine a light inside in order to see the mold. Unfortunately, not catching this one had terrible consequences. Everyone in my house got sick, including my toddler and 4-month-old, and that persisted a good 2 weeks or so.\r\n\r\nAnother misfortune: mold remediation is expensive. What started out as a $100 duct cleaning turned into a $500 duct cleaning and mold removal.

title: "My Challenges as a New Homeowner",
date: "2016-12-15 00:35:29"

The reality that home ownership is a nightmare and a money suck is week by week etching itself into my mind. I am a not yet a month in and have already dealt with a handful of costly challenges that I never expected going into the deal. It appears everyone has their own seemingly unique set of issues to sort out, so there is no definitive list you could use to ensure all your \"T\"s are crossed and \"I\"s dotted. <!--more Read post-->\r\n\r\n<strong>1. Rats in the attic<\/strong>\r\n\r\nA week into moving out of our old place, my wife and I sat down at our dining table after a day of packing moving and cleaning around 10PM. All of a sudden we heard a scratching noise running up the wall and across the ceiling. We looked at each other, jaws dropped; we knew we had some sort of pest to deal with. I ran upstairs with a flashlight and open the hatch. Lo and behold, a rat was staring at me from the other side of the attic.\r\n\r\nAmong the different types of pest control methods attempted, what has worked so far are the standard wood and metal bar snap traps. I've killed two rats in them, and I'm certain a third is still hiding, avoiding the fate of its comrades. I may need to switch up the peanut butter and use something more enticing to catch this straggler.\r\n\r\n<strong>2. Plumbing\/Sewer Issues<\/strong>\r\n\r\nAbout a week after moving in, I began to smell some odd odor coming from the guest bathroom. Fast forward to this week, the smell is unbearable if the door is shut and the ventilation turned off. Something in there has gotten progressively worse.\r\n\r\nWe made a claim with our home warrant company, and they sent a plumber over to diagnose the issue yesterday. He noticed the wax seal under our toilet was nearly gone, so he replaced that. After waiting several hours and rechecking, the smell persisted. So that was $60 down the drain, and no skin off the home warranty company's back.\r\n\r\nAs of yesterday I finally found that most of the odor is coming from the bathtub drain, so I'm currently attempting to neutralize it with bleach. Really hoping to not have to do any major repairs.\r\n\r\n<strong>3. Created an account for water and electricity, but not gas<\/strong>\r\n\r\nOur furnace and water heater are run by gas, not electricity. I found that out two days ago when my wife texted me saying the heater wasn't working, and she couldn't get hot water. Called Atmos, and the soonest the can come out is tomorrow. So we are now on day two of no showers (it's 38 degrees F in Dallas at the moment), and the fireplace and space heaters are in full effect.\r\n\r\n<strong>4.

title: "Blog Every Day, Even If No One Reads (and working out)",
date: "2016-12-18 23:05:49"
---

Last week I attended Digital Summit, and the first keynote speaker was Seth Godin. Of the many quotes I was able to capture and tweet from his speech and Q&amp;A session, one was the title of this post. We should blog every day to get our head straight--something like that. So, here I am, taking his advice.<!--more Read post-->\r\n\r\nI was actually inspired to write regularly a couple weeks prior by Jordan Peterson, the professor at University of Toronto who has been in the news much lately. He believes that writing down thoughts and working out our issues through writing is not only effective, but also rewires our brain in positive ways. He hawked his Future Writing Program on his spot on Joe Rogan's podcast, and I got it online from his website free. For the past 15 years or so I haven't been the type to think heavily about my future, further than perhaps morw than 5 years at a time. I haven't started on the exercise yet so I'm not sure what to expect, but I do hope it turns out to be as rewarding as he said it would be.\r\n\r\nAll this has come, like most things in life seem to, at a timely moment where I feel more upside down than most others. I just bought a house and after two weeks am still a good 30% away from a decent completion point of my move; my wife and kids just got over being sick; my workout routine has lost its rhythm; my bedtime and waking time have gotten later and more taxing on my day. The latter two I consider the most concerning of them all; it seems once I lose my sleep and exercise patterns, the rest of the habits that keep me afloat start coming down one by one. It would seem to me a great time to stop and reconsider my life by means of writing, as suggested by these great thinkers and influencers.\r\n\r\nSaving other topics for other days, I'll dig into working out. It's the habit I've always strived to maintain, but have without fail always done in sprints of a few months and slowly given up. I'd say the first of these sprints began around 10th grade when, as a new kid at a new high school, I experienced a few instances of bullying by a certain upper classmen. Though it was more of a brief intimidation each time, the guy was significantly bigger than I was and was almost always heckling together with his jock friends. I've always been the smaller guy, and at the time I hadn't been in more than a couple of fights in my life, so I was easy to intimidate for this guy. After the second incident, I went home and started curling my guitar in its hard case, determined to do something about my size and defend myself against the likes of that guy. I guess that was my first self-motivated workout experience.\r\n\r\nFast forward to my post college years, circa mid 2011, I had gained a lot more experience of mostly body weight workouts, and I joined a dance team. After one of our practices for whatever reason I propose arm wrestling and gut punching with the other guys. Only one (Juan) was able to beat me at arm wrestling, and no one punched out my gut to stoppage. I realized I was naturally stronger than many of those guys and I liked the feeling--just about the first time in my life I had the upper hand in strength among my peers. I score a dumbell swt from my room mate, and I still work out with that set to this very day.\r\n\r\nIt would seem to me that working out has much more to do with my psyche than I realize at any given time. I work out consistently when I'm feeling good, and when I'm in that rhythm, I feel even better from day to day. What I struggle with the most is ignoring my mood and working out in spite of it, which has to happen since I'm not guaranteed a good mood everyday. There are only benefits to doing so, including improving my mood at that instant, and more importantly, keeping the rhythm of the work out habit to maintain the order of things in my life.\r\n\r\nI have more daily habits with similar issues I want to draw comparisons to, but in the interest of time and sustainable blogging I will save them for another time. Takeaway #1 to blog everyday, and #2 is to work out everyday, regardless of my mood.

One lesson I've heard repeatedly but can't say I've fully learned is the correlation between essential items of our physical life and their spiritual counterparts\u2014specifically, eating. We maintain our physical life by eating regularly. In my case, that's 3 to 5 different sized meals per day. What I eat, how much I eat, and how often I eat dictate an enormous part of my resulting physical state of being (I have heard\u00a080%). If I want to grow or shrink in stature, I need to adjust my eating. If I want to be healthy or sick, I also adjust my eating. If I skip meals, my temperament, behavior and appearance are affected. If I stop eating, eventually I will die. <!--more Read post-->\r\n\r\nSo it is in the spiritual realm. Matthew 4:4 of the New Testament says that man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God. The first part of Jeremiah 15:15 says, Your words were found, and I ate them. In the spiritual realm, the word of God is man's food. It sustains his spiritual life, causes him to grow, adjusts his expression, and composes his entire spiritual being, just as physical sustenance does for man's body.\r\n\r\nWhy then skip a Bible reading hour? Why skip it for a week? If I wake up late and miss breakfast just once, that same day I'm not myself by noon, and I'm not thinking of anything else except what I'm going to eat. I can't say I don't have a similar feeling towards reading, but if I were to compare the two, it's obviously much easier to skip the reading than the meal. Then again, I do also notice the same lack of discipline with eating in regards to strength training and bodybuilding goals. In both scenarios I have to preach to myself day in and day out that the regular, seemingly small intervals of eating are not inconsequential; rather, they contribute to my long-term goals and are not at all optional.\r\n\r\nIf I'm honest with myself, I've always only ever done the bare minimum to survive, whether with physical or spiritual eating. In physical eating that could mean eating just any meal or skipping a meal, and making a habit out of it; in spiritual, reading once per week or in particularly low times, once every two weeks. I don't know that I want to dig deeper into personal reasonings for this, but I definitely want to once and for all get it through my head that I can't consider this acceptable anymore. With certain concrete goals in life, I have to do my daily diligence in taking one step closer to where I want to be. In this case, that starts with establishing healthy habits of every day eating with purpose, and every day taking in the word of God. It has to be in the same category as brushing my teeth and taking a shower every night before bed. I have to tap into the part of my human brain that caters to regular habits.\r\n\r\nI'm thankful that tomorrow morning is a new day.

I recently had a conversation with two high school friends about conspiracy theories and the last days. Apparently there is a ton of new developments regarding apocalyptic events in the past few years that I was completely unaware of prior to our conversation. You can get lost keeping track of everything going on; there are so many details that could potentially apply or point to the beginnings of this or that prophecy. Hats off to those diligent enough to keep tabs. I'm not one to recognize things of this sort until they are nearly right in front of my face.\r\n\r\nIn a sense I feel it is not completely necessary for me to keep such close tabs, for a number of reasons. For one, a certain other friend of ours made a comment that once certain things are upon us, there is little we can do to prepare for them in the outward sense of sourcing food and water or amassing weapons. I do agree with that for the most part. Second, in considering the four riders of the horses in Revelation, there have always been the three negative ones running (death, famine and sickness), and they will continue to run until the end of the current age, but as a Christian my role is to consider the white horse (gospel) and opportunities for it to gain ground in the race.\r\n\r\nThat said, I do feel this type of discussion does a great job of waking me up and sobering my mind. It's all too easy to get distracted by daily necessities and the cares in the world, and to remain in that state for periods of time, and to forget about what is truly important. I do believe a Christian should live in a normal way, with longevity in mind, taking care of human resoonsibilities. But he also needs to be aware that things can change--major things--within a very short period of time, and live soberly, as if on any given day he would be taken to meet his master. That I feel I've personally neglected for quite some time and am slowly coming to grips with the reality I've always held to be true in my core. But you know what they say: admission is the first step.\r\n\r\nWith recent events occurring in the world scenario, the overwhelming theme we can see is an increased propensity for chaos and instability, with social media and the internet as a multiplier, along with subtle desensitization of our generation. I can't say that anything has happened to directly fulfill any word (if it has I don't know of it), but it's easy to see that the stage is being set for an interesting turn of events.

I have a good friend from Albania I was able to catch up with tonight. After having known him through a previous job for just over three years, tonight our conversation revealed I knew very little about him. Tonight I feel our relationship went a little further, all within a short hour and a half. After some small talk about typical things we've always bound our conversations to--who he is dating, what we have been doing at work, vacations, etc--I somehow brought up a book I am currently reading about the former Soviet Union and its labor camps.\u00a0<!--more Read post--> Having heard very little about the regime in history courses and politics, I never put together the fact that Albania was once part of it, and that my good friend actually lived through the tail end of it! You can imagine all of the questions I had for him once I found out.\r\n\r\nAfter hearing about things his family experienced before the Iron Curtain fell, we also started talking about the civil war in Albania in '97. As he was talking I felt extremely privileged to have his company, having experienced what he did and being so open to talk about it. I didn't think I would ever have had the opportunity to sit down with someone with first hand experience of that type of conflict, half a world away from me here in the priviledged US.\r\n\r\nI feel I've gotten some insight on a lesson I need to learn; that is, the value of getting to know someone beyond surface level interaction and friendship, uncovering the wealth of life experience--especially as it differs so greatly from my own--they are holding inside, consciously or not. I normally only ever put this hat of consciousness in interaction with others while I'm traveling to a new place or in some type of unfamiliar environment. In this way, I miss out on the wealth of experience of those immediately around me--I miss out. Tonight I have a new appreciation of my friend, and I hope to continue our friendship in an increasingly more meaningful way from here on.

I have a good friend from Albania I was able to catch up with tonight. After having known him through a previous job for just over three years, tonight our conversation revealed I knew very little about him. Tonight I feel our relationship went a little further, all within a short hour and a half. After some small talk about typical things we've always bound our conversations to--who he is dating, what we have been doing at work, vacations, etc--I somehow brought up a book I am currently reading about the former Soviet Union and its labor camps. Having heard very little about the regime in history courses and politics, I never put together the fact that Albania was once part of it, and that my good friend actually lived through the tail end of it! You can imagine all of the questions I had for him once I found out.\r\n\r\nAfter hearing about things his family experienced before the Iron Curtain fell, we also started talking about the civil war in Albania in '97. As he was talking I felt extremely privileged to have his company, having experienced what he did and being so open to talk about it. I didn't think I would ever have had the opportunity to sit down with someone with first hand experience of that type of conflict, half a world away from me here in the priviledged US.\r\n\r\nI feel I've gotten some insight on a lesson I need to learn; that is, the value of getting to know someone beyond surface level interaction and friendship, uncovering the wealth of life experience--especially as it differs so greatly from my own--they are holding inside, consciously or not. I normally only ever put this hat of consciousness in interaction with others while I'm traveling to a new place or in some type of unfamiliar environment. In this way, I miss out on the wealth of experience of those immediately around me--I miss out. Tonight I have a new appreciation of my friend, and I hope to continue our friendship in an increasingly more meaningful way from here on.

My personal laptop is a late 2009 Macbook Pro with 4GB of RAM, 250GB hard drive, 2.53 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, making it 7 years old at the time I'm writing this post. As Apple released updates over the years, like anyone else I was always excited to try out the newest features and installed each one as soon as I could. However, as I upgraded, I noticed my laptop get progressively slower, until it was an absolute pain to use.\u00a0<!--more Read post-->\r\n\r\nThe solution for me was to give up on the upgrades and downgrade\u00a0to Mountain Lion (10.8.5). My Macbook is now back in proper shape, running smoothly with no issues (it has been a couple weeks now). I will no longer upgrade past this version; I'm just using TIme Machine to back up my files to an external hard drive and will restore a previous backed up version if something happens in the future.\r\n\r\nI'm not going to detail the reinstall here since there are so many tutorials online you can simply Google. But I will share my steps in a summarized way:\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Back up my files using Time Machine and an external drive<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Download Mountain Lion from the Mac App Store<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Download <a href=\"http:\/\/diskmakerx.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">DiskMaker X<\/a>\u00a0(an older version of it) and made a bootable USB drive with Mountain Lion*<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Boot from the USB drive and follow the install prompts (restart and hold Option after hearing the startup sound)<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n* If I recall correctly, I may have ended up using Disk Utility instead of DiskMaker X, after having some issues and looking up another install method. The page I found had me pull a folder from within the Mountain Lion install file and create a bootable disk with that. I'd try both if one way doesn't work.\r\n\r\nIt took a handful of attempts to complete the install.

If you have a 2009 Macbook Pro like I do, by now you have either\u00a0replaced your battery or you need to. In my case, my battery wouldn't last even an hour on a full charge, and I had a \"Service Battery\" message in my toolbar.\u00a0Fortunately, it is a simple, relatively inexpensive process you can do yourself in five to ten minutes, and afterward you should not have to do it again for another 5 years or so at least.<!--more Read post-->\r\n\r\nNo need for a new tutorial; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ifixit.com\/Guide\/MacBook+Pro+13-Inch+Unibody+Mid+2009+Battery+Replacement\/1332\" target=\"_blank\">here's a great one from ifixit.com<\/a>.\r\n\r\nThe only point I'd like to add is I don't believe you don't need to buy a $99 battery from ifixit or from Apple; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/s\/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=2009+macbook+pro+battery\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon has plenty of third party options available<\/a>. I don't remember the brand I bought, but I did some research and checked reviews before purchasing. I didn't spend over $50.\r\n\r\nYou will need a tri-wing screwdriver, which is annoying since you probably won't use it for anything else. The battery I bought provided that and the philips screwdriver,\u00a0included\u00a0with the battery.

My wife did a bit of research and found there was a good amount of kid-friendly activities there during the holidays, so we packed our stuff and jumped on the road for 15 hours.\u00a0<!--more Read post-->\r\n\r\n<strong>Ruby Falls<\/strong>\r\n\r\nRuby Falls is an underground waterfall\u2014I heard it was one of the world's deepest waterfalls, at 1120 feet down\u2014inside a cavern tunnel, discovered early last century. They don't allow strollers, but now that our two-year-old can handle walking good distances on her own, our baby carrier was freed up for our five-month-old (who handled the walk fine, from start to finish). Similar to Carlsbad Caverns, Ruby Falls Cave is full of unique rock formations, formed by dripping water over who knows how many hundreds and maybe thousands of years.\r\n\r\nThe waterfall itself is stunning\u2014145 feet tall, with timed lighting installed so you can see the whole thing (you get about two minutes to see it and take your pictures). Our tour guide warned us not to try and drink the water, since it has a ton of magnesium and there are no bathrooms down there for you to relieve yourself if you make that mistake. If you're lucky, your group is not too large and you have a chance to get a picture in and get near the water pool. Otherwise, you'll have to use some assertiveness and push your way\u00a0through when the time is right.\r\n\r\nSince it was Christmas season they had an additional exhibit in the cave. It was a Santa's village type of thing I can't remember the name of. They have decorations up and little activities for the kids to do, including picking geodes and breaking them open, panning for precious stones, and pictures with Santa. Unfortunately, my kids were pretty tired by the end of the cave tour, so they didn't enjoy it as much as they could have, and they don't like Santa either. But other people's kids looked like they were having a blast!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/ruby-falls.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-334\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-334 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/ruby-falls.jpg\" alt=\"Ruby Falls\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/ruby-falls-02.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-335\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-335\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/ruby-falls-02.jpg\" alt=\"Ruby Falls Cave Formations\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<strong>Rock City<\/strong>\r\n\r\nA little further up Lookout\u00a0Mountain is Rock City Gardens, an area of trails that is something like an arboretum with rock formations. In addition to all of the different types of greenery and rocks, there are a couple of unbelievably\u00a0tight areas you have to squeeze through on the trails (Fat Man Squeeze), as well as a big waterfall on Lover's Leap, and a point on top of a cliff where you can see seven surrounding states on a clear day. There is also an underground cave section filled with gnomes and remarkable scenes from traditional fairy tales put together, illuminated by black light. If you grew up hearing Mother Goose tales, it will be a trip back through your childhood.\r\n\r\nHere they also had a holiday-themed event at night, which makes it look like a completely different attraction with all of the Christmas lights decorating the area. Another great one for the kids (and dogs, if you brought one along).\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/rock-city.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-336\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-336\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/rock-city.jpg\" alt=\"Fat Man Squeeze, Rock City\" width=\"500\" height=\"666\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/lovers-leap.gif\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-337\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-337\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/lovers-leap.gif\" alt=\"Lover's Leap, Rock City\" width=\"921\" height=\"532\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<strong>Hickory Pit Bar-B-Que<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThis is a random one that I'd assume you wouldn't see on other sites about Chattanooga, but we had such a good experience I had to include it here. One evening, probably December 23, we found ourselves looking for dinner around 8:30\u00a0in East Ridge, outside of Chattanooga. I noticed this small restaurant on Ringgold Road called Hickory Pit Bar-B-Que, with a mom and pop look to it, and a drive thru window\u2014perfect for us, since the kids were asleep in the car. I pull up to the window after checking out the menu, and see the sign that they were closed at 8. As I put the car back in drive and start to pull of, disappointed, all of a sudden the drive thru window opens and a girl looks at us and asks, \"What'd y'all want?\" Even though they\u00a0had been closed for a good 30 minutes, she took our order and took care of us with a smile, extremely friendly and accommodating.\r\n\r\nWhen we got to the hotel and opened everything up, we had a ton of food for under $30, and it was incredibly delicious. Everything from the chopped beef and chicken to the potato salad and baked beans was full of flavor\u2014the right amount of smoky flavor and an extra thing of tangy barbecue sauce on the side. She hooked it up! I tried to go back before we left, but they were closed until the new year, due to the holiday.\r\n\r\nWe also visited the aquarium the Coolidge Park carousel, the Pura Vida smoothie shop next to that, and other small local things I'll have to go through pictures to recall. Overall, we loved the city and want to go back to see more stuff. There seems to be a ton of fun nature activities to do there when it's not so cold, which we would love to do after dropping the kids off with a babysitter. The people there were also some of the nicest we've met, everyone real friendly and welcoming (we are multiracial). Until next time, Chattanooga!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;

We picked this place as our next road trip in a semi-random way. My wife did a bit of research and found there was a good amount of kid-friendly activities there during the holidays, so we packed our stuff and jumped on the road for 15 hours.\r\n\r\n<strong>Ruby Falls<\/strong>\r\n\r\nRuby Falls is an underground waterfall\u2014I heard it was one of the world's deepest waterfalls, at 1120 feet down\u2014inside a cavern tunnel, discovered early last century. They don't allow strollers, but now that our two-year-old can handle walking good distances on her own, our baby carrier was freed up for our five-month-old (who handled the walk fine, from start to finish). Similar to Carlsbad Caverns, Ruby Falls Cave is full of unique rock formations, formed by dripping water over who knows how many hundreds and maybe thousands of years.\r\n\r\nThe waterfall itself is stunning\u2014145 feet tall, with timed lighting installed so you can see the whole thing (you get about two minutes to see it and take your pictures). Our tour guide warned us not to try and drink the water, since it has a ton of magnesium and there are no bathrooms down there for you to relieve yourself if you make that mistake. If you're lucky, your group is not too large and you have a chance to get a picture in and get near the water pool. Otherwise, you'll have to use some assertiveness and push your way\u00a0through when the time is right.\r\n\r\nSince it was Christmas season they had an additional exhibit in the cave. It was a Santa's village type of thing I can't remember the name of. They have decorations up and little activities for the kids to do, including picking geodes and breaking them open, panning for precious stones, and pictures with Santa. Unfortunately, my kids were pretty tired by the end of the cave tour, so they didn't enjoy it as much as they could have, and they don't like Santa either. But other people's kids looked like they were having a blast!\r\n\r\n<strong>Rock City<\/strong>\r\n\r\nA little further up Lookout\u00a0Mountain is Rock City Gardens, an area of trails that is something like an arboretum with rock formations. In addition to all of the different types of greenery and rocks, there are a couple of unbelievably\u00a0tight areas you have to squeeze through on the trails (Fat Man Squeeze), as well as a big waterfall on Lover's Leap, and a point on top of a cliff where you can see seven surrounding states on a clear day. There is also an underground cave section

[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"298\"]<img class=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/assets.schwarzenegger.com\/images\/img-1.jpg\" alt=\"Pumping iron. Image from schwarzenegger.com\" width=\"298\" height=\"199\" \/> Pumping iron. Image from schwarzenegger.com[\/caption]\r\n\r\nYesterday at the recommendation of a friend, I watched\u00a0Arnold Schwarzenegger's\u00a0<em>Pumping Iron<\/em> on Netflix. Great little documentary-type film about Arnold in his prime in Mr. Olympia competitions. I heard a few interesting quotes during some of Arnold's interviews that, though shocking in some instances, I was able to take some lessons from. This post is about one of those lessons.\u00a0<!--more Read post-->\r\n\r\nI can't remember what he said\u00a0verbatim, so I'll have to paraphrase. Perhaps the most shocking thing I heard in the film was Arnold talking about his reaction to his father's death. At some point he decided to cut the world off, emotionally, so that nothing would interfere with his mindset of training to win competitions. He described it as making himself cold and emotionless, shrugging off things that would normally be quite serious. His car was stolen, so he had a secretary handle it with insurance and laughed it off, and got back to training. However, during his training for a competition, two months away, his mother called and gave him the news that his father had died, and asked if he would be coming back home for the funeral. His response was something like, \"It's too late, he's already dead; there's nothing more to be done, so I'm not going to the funeral.\" That, he said, was one of the most difficult times of his life.\r\n\r\nAn extreme case, but I do believe there is something to be said about this kind of mindset in accomplishing one's goals. I once heard a message by Ron Kangas in which he spoke briefly about sisters (women) in general being more given to feelings and emotions, while brothers (men) get stuck in their minds and logic. He then went back and said that, in some cases, however, the brothers who feel they are being logical are actually controlled by their emotions and don't realize it.\r\n\r\nWhat is really getting in the way of our following through with things we've set out to do? Is it really that unexpected situations got in the way? In my case, I want to get up everyday at 6AM to get certain things done before I go to work. I want to read the Bible, work out, and have a proper breakfast. but apparently something always happens to prevent me from getting to bed on time. The truth is, nothing is really getting in the way; if I want to sleep by 10 and get up at 6, I need to shut everything down and just do it. I've just been too controlled by how I feel at the moment, making excuses for staying up or not wanting to get up. Taking Arnold's way, I need to practice\u00a0shutting off my emotion and do what I need to do, regardless of how I feel.\r\n\r\nI do believe in the power of building up a habit of doing things you don't want to do, or want to do but don't feel like doing. On a YouTube episode, Elliot Hulse advises to do one small thing you don't want to do, every day. The human will is like a muscle that needs to be exercised and built up on a regular basis. Once you build up that muscle, or habit, it becomes easier to use. Neglect it, and it atrophies, and things become more difficult.\r\n\r\nSo actually, working out and fulfilling goals are very much related. Every day I need to ignore my feelings and get in my cold, dark garage and lift those weights. I also need to do the same with my reading, and just get it done, regardless of what else is going on. These healthy habits day after day will build up a healthy person, physically, mentally, and spiritually.

Image from schwarzenegger.com\" width=\"729\" height=\"423\" \/> Pumping iron. Image from schwarzenegger.com[\/caption]\r\n\r\nYesterday at the recommendation of a friend, I watched\u00a0Arnold Schwarzenegger's\u00a0<em>Pumping Iron<\/em> on Netflix. Great little documentary-type film about Arnold in his prime in Mr. Olympia competitions. I heard a few interesting quotes during some of Arnold's interviews that, though shocking in some instances, I was able to take some lessons from. This post is about one of those lessons.\r\n\r\nI can't remember what he said\u00a0verbatim, so I'll have to paraphrase. Perhaps the most shocking thing I heard in the film was Arnold talking about his reaction to his father's death. At some point he decided to cut the world off, emotionally, so that nothing would interfere with his mindset of training to win competitions. He described it as making himself cold and emotionless, shrugging off things that would normally be quite serious. His car was stolen, so he had a secretary handle it with insurance and laughed it off, and got back to training. However, during his training for a competition, two months away, his mother called and gave him the news that his father had died, and asked if he would be coming back home for the funeral. His response was something like, \"It's too late, he's already dead; there's nothing more to be done, so I'm not going to the funeral.\" That, he said, was one of the most difficult times of his life.\r\n\r\nAn extreme case, but I do believe there is something to be said about this kind of mindset in accomplishing one's goals. I once heard a message by Ron Kangas in which he spoke briefly about sisters (women) in general being more given to feelings and emotions, while brothers (men) get stuck in their minds and logic. He then went back and said that, in some cases, however, the brothers who feel they are being logical are actually controlled by their emotions and don't realize it.\r\n\r\nWhat is really getting in the way of our following through with things we've set out to do? Is it really that unexpected situations got in the way? In my case, I want to get up everyday at 6AM to get certain things done before I go to work. I want to read the Bible, work out, and have a proper breakfast. but apparently something always happens to prevent me from getting to bed on time. The truth is, nothing is really getting in the way; if I want to sleep by 10 and get up at 6, I need to shut everything down and just do it. I've just been too controlled by how I feel at the moment, making excuses for staying up or not wanting to get up. Taking Arnold's way, I need to practice\u00a0shutting off my emotion and do what I need to do, regardless of how I feel.\r\n\r\nI do believe in the power of building up a habit of doing things you don't want to do, or want to do but don't feel like doing. On a YouTube episode, Elliot Hulse advises to do one small thing you don't want to do, every day. The human will is like a muscle that needs to be exercised and built up on a regular basis. Once you build up that muscle, or habit, it becomes easier to use. Neglect it, and it atrophies, and things become more difficult.\r\n\r\nSo actually, working out and fulfilling goals are very much related. Every day I need to ignore my feelings and get in my cold, dark garage and lift those weights. I also need to do the same with my reading, and just get it done, regardless of what else is going on.

My wife did a bit of research and found there was a good amount of kid-friendly activities there during the holidays, so we packed our stuff and jumped on the road for 15 hours.\u00a0<!--more Read post-->\n\n<strong>Ruby Falls<\/strong>\n\nRuby Falls is an underground waterfall\u2014I heard it was one of the world's deepest waterfalls, at 1120 feet down\u2014inside a cavern tunnel, discovered early last century. They don't allow strollers, but now that our two-year-old can handle walking good distances on her own, our baby carrier was freed up for our five-month-old (who handled the walk fine, from start to finish). Similar to Carlsbad Caverns, Ruby Falls Cave is full of unique rock formations, formed by dripping water over who knows how many hundreds and maybe thousands of years.\n\nThe waterfall itself is stunning\u2014145 feet tall, with timed lighting installed so you can see the whole thing (you get about two minutes to see it and take your pictures). Our tour guide warned us not to try and drink the water, since it has a ton of magnesium and there are no bathrooms down there for you to relieve yourself if you make that mistake. If you're lucky, your group is not too large and you have a chance to get a picture in and get near the water pool. Otherwise, you'll have to use some assertiveness and push your way\u00a0through when the time is right.\n\nSince it was Christmas season they had an additional exhibit in the cave. It was a Santa's village type of thing I can't remember the name of. They have decorations up and little activities for the kids to do, including picking geodes and breaking them open, panning for precious stones, and pictures with Santa. Unfortunately, my kids were pretty tired by the end of the cave tour, so they didn't enjoy it as much as they could have, and they don't like Santa either. But other people's kids looked like they were having a blast!\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/ruby-falls.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-334\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-334 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/ruby-falls.jpg\" alt=\"Ruby Falls\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" \/><\/a>\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/ruby-falls-02.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-335\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-335\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/ruby-falls-02.jpg\" alt=\"Ruby Falls Cave Formations\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" \/><\/a>\n\n<strong>Rock City<\/strong>\n\nA little further up Lookout\u00a0Mountain is Rock City Gardens, an area of trails that is something like an arboretum with rock formations. In addition to all of the different types of greenery and rocks, there are a couple of unbelievably\u00a0tight areas you have to squeeze through on the trails (Fat Man Squeeze), as well as a big waterfall on Lover's Leap, and a point on top of a cliff where you can see seven surrounding states on a clear day. There is also an underground cave section filled with gnomes and remarkable scenes from traditional fairy tales put together, illuminated by black light. If you grew up hearing Mother Goose tales, it will be a trip back through your childhood.\n\nHere they also had a holiday-themed event at night, which makes it look like a completely different attraction with all of the Christmas lights decorating the area.

One evening, probably December 23, we found ourselves looking for dinner around 8:30\u00a0in East Ridge, outside of Chattanooga. I noticed this small restaurant on Ringgold Road called Hickory Pit Bar-B-Que, with a mom and pop look to it, and a drive thru window\u2014perfect for us, since the kids were asleep in the car. I pull up to the window after checking out the menu, and see the sign that they were closed at 8. As I put the car back in drive and start to pull of, disappointed, all of a sudden the drive thru window opens and a girl looks at us and asks, \"What'd y'all want?\" Even though they\u00a0had been closed for a good 30 minutes, she took our order and took care of us with a smile, extremely friendly and accommodating.\n\nWhen we got to the hotel and opened everything up, we had a ton of food for under $30, and it was incredibly delicious. Everything from the chopped beef and chicken to the potato salad and baked beans was full of flavor\u2014the right amount of smoky flavor and an extra thing of tangy barbecue sauce on the side. She hooked it up! I tried to go back before we left, but they were closed until the new year, due to the holiday.\n\nWe also visited the aquarium the Coolidge Park carousel, the Pura Vida smoothie shop next to that, and other small local things I'll have to go through pictures to recall. Overall, we loved the city and want to go back to see more stuff. There seems to be a ton of fun nature activities to do there when it's not so cold, which we would love to do after dropping the kids off with a babysitter. The people there were also some of the nicest we've met, everyone real friendly and welcoming (we are multiracial). Until next time, Chattanooga!\n\n&nbsp;

Another great one for the kids (and dogs, if you brought one along).\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/rock-city.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-336\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-336\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/rock-city.jpg\" alt=\"Fat Man Squeeze, Rock City\" width=\"500\" height=\"666\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/lovers-leap.gif\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-337\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-337\" src=\"http:\/\/andrewdelosreyes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/lovers-leap.gif\" alt=\"Lover's Leap, Rock City\" width=\"921\" height=\"532\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<strong>Hickory Pit Bar-B-Que<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThis is a random one that I'd assume you wouldn't see on other sites about Chattanooga, but we had such a good experience I had to include it here. One evening, probably December 23, we found ourselves looking for dinner around 8:30\u00a0in East Ridge, outside of Chattanooga. I noticed this small restaurant on Ringgold Road called Hickory Pit Bar-B-Que, with a mom and pop look to it, and a drive thru window\u2014perfect for us, since the kids were asleep in the car. I pull up to the window after checking out the menu, and see the sign that they were closed at 8. As I put the car back in drive and start to pull of, disappointed, all of a sudden the drive thru window opens and a girl looks at us and asks, \"What'd y'all want?\" Even though they\u00a0had been closed for a good 30 minutes, she took our order and took care of us with a smile, extremely friendly and accommodating.\r\n\r\nWhen we got to the hotel and opened everything up, we had a ton of food for under $30, and it was incredibly delicious. Everything from the chopped beef and chicken to the potato salad and baked beans was full of flavor\u2014the right amount of smoky flavor and an extra thing of tangy barbecue sauce on the side. She hooked it up! I tried to go back before we left, but they were closed until the new year, due to the holiday.\r\n\r\nWe also visited the aquarium the Coolidge Park carousel, the Pura Vida smoothie shop next to that, and other small local things I'll have to go through pictures to recall. Overall, we loved the city and want to go back to see more stuff. There seems to be a ton of fun nature activities to do there when it's not so cold, which we would love to do after dropping the kids off with a babysitter. The people there were also some of the nicest we've met, everyone real friendly and welcoming (we are multiracial). Until next time, Chattanooga!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;
